This project provides an isomorphic Javascript package with TypeScript definitions that makes it easy to consume and manage
Microsoft Azure Services.
It supports SDKs for:

- ARM services (control plane) (packages with the naming convention of `@azure/arm-<servicename>`)
- data plane of some Azure services (packages with the naming convention of `@azure/<servicename>`).

## Documentation

Documentation of the supported SDKs can be found here:

- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/azure - This website primarily provides SDK documentation for

  - ARM based services (`@azure/arm-<serviceName>`)
  - data plane SDKs like `@azure/batch`, `@azure/graph`, etc.

## Authentication

- For Node.js-based authentication, look at [@azure/ms-rest-nodeauth](https://npmjs.com/package/@azure/ms-rest-nodeauth).
- For browser-based authentication, look at [@azure/ms-rest-browserauth](https://npmjs.com/package/@azure/ms-rest-browserauth).
  - The browser authentication storage is a little more complicated, so we encourage you to [read about how it works](https://github.com/Azure/ms-rest-browserauth/blob/master/README.md) before putting it in your application.
