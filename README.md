This repository is for active development of the Azure SDK for JavaScript (NodeJS & Browser). For consumers of the SDK we recommend visiting our [public developer docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/azure/) or our versioned [developer docs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-js).

## Getting started

For your convenience, each service has a separate set of libraries that you can choose to use instead of one, large Azure package. To get started with a specific library, see the **README.md** file located in the library's project folder. You can find service libraries in the `/sdk` directory.

Each service might have a number of libraries available from each of the following categories:

- [Client - New Releases](#client-new-releases)
- [Client - Previous Versions](#client-previous-versions)
- [Management](#management)

### Client: New Releases

New wave of packages that we are announcing as **GA** and several that are currently releasing in **preview** on `npm`. These libraries allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them. These libraries share a number of core functionalities found in the Azure Core package such as retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc. Learn more about these libraries by reading [the guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/typescript/guidelines/) that they follow.

You can find the [most up to date list of all of the new packages on our page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/index.html#javascript-packages)

> NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-preview libraries.

### Client: Previous Versions

Last stable versions of packages that have been provided for usage with Azure and are production-ready. These libraries provide you with similar functionalities to the Preview ones as they allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. They might not implement the [guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/typescript_introduction.html) or have the same feature set as the Novemeber releases. They do however offer wider coverage of services.

### Management

Libraries which enable you to provision specific resources. They are responsible for directly mirroring and consuming Azure service's REST endpoints. You can recognize these libraries by `mgmt` or `arm` in their package names.
