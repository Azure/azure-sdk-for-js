# ts-package-json-files-required

Requires `files` in `package.json` to contain paths to the package contents.

Specifically, this rule looks for inclusion of `dist`, `dist-esm/src`, and `src` as either just those directories or specific subdirectories

This rule is fixable using the `--fix` option.

## Examples

### Good

```json
{
  "files": ["dist", "dist-esm/src"]
}
```

```json
{
  "files": ["./dist", "./dist-esm/src"]
}
```

```json
{
  "files": ["dist/", "dist-esm/"]
}
```

```json
{
  "files": ["dist/lib", "dist-esm/src/lib"]
}
```

### Bad

```json
{
  "files": ["dist", "src"]
}
```

```json
{
  "files": ["dist"]
}
```

```json
{
  "files": []
}
```

```json
{}
```

## When to turn off

Only if the rule breaks.

, as the rules are similar enough to not exist separately for linting purposes.
