/**
 * This file loads our monkey patch for module resolution in samples and
 * tests. We use this to make sure that TS/ES loading is supported and that
 * path-mapped imports work without rewriting them.
 *
 * As a forewarning to anyone who comes to this module and thinks: "Why can't
 * we rewrite this in TypeScript," keep in mind that this module is used to
 * bootstrap loading of typescript code at runtime within dev-tool. Rewriting
 * this module in TypeScript is likely possible, but challenging. In plain
 * old JavaScript, it is simple enough.
