# @azure/dev-tool

`dev-tool` is an extensible command-line utility for Azure SDK for JS contributors.

It provides a place to centralize scripts, resources, and processes for development of the Azure SDK for JavaScript. It is its own unpublished package and has the ability to use dependencies that are managed with Rush in the development process, and it is written in TypeScript.

## Installation

`dev-tool` runs using ts-node, so it does not need to be built. It is ready-to-go after a `rush update`. It additionally does not need to be installed to a user's machine in order to be used in `package.json` scripts, since it provides the `dev-tool` binary to any dependent packages through the `bin` entry in its `package.json`. Simply add `@azure/dev-tool` to the `devDependencies` of a package, and the `dev-tool` binary will become available. If you wish to use `dev-tool` from the CLI manually, you can install it globally on your system by running `npm install -g` from this directory.

## Usage

`dev-tool` uses a command hierarchy. For example, at the time of writing, the command tree looks like this:

`dev-tool`

- `about` (display command help and information)
- `package`
  - `resolve` (display information about the project that owns a directory)
- `samples`
  - `dev` (link samples to local sources for access to IntelliSense during development)
  - `prep` (prepare samples for local source-linked execution)
  - `run` (execute a sample or all samples within a directory)
  - `check-node-versions` (execute samples with different node versions, typically in preparation for release)
- `test-proxy`
  - `start` (start the test-proxy tool. This requires docker.)
  - `wait-for-proxy-endpoint` (waits until the proxy endpoint is ready or aborts in 120 seconds, whichever happens first)
- `run`

  - `test:node-ts-input` (runs the node tests with TS input files with the default mocha configs, and concurrently runs the proxy tool in record/playback modes if it is not already active)

    - Mocha settings added by default

      > `-r esm -r ts-node/register --reporter ../../../common/tools/mocha-multi-reporter.js --full-trace`

    - Example usage

      ```bash
      dev-tool run test:node-ts-input -- --timeout 1200000 'test/*.spec.ts'
      ```
  - `test:node-js-input` (runs the node tests with JS input files with the default mocha configs, and concurrently runs the proxy tool in record/playback modes if it is not already active)

    - Mocha settings added by default

      > `-r esm --require source-map-support/register --reporter ../../../common/tools/mocha-multi-reporter.js --full-trace`

    - Also, calls mocha with `nyc` for code coverage

    - Example usage

      ```bash
      dev-tool run test:node-js-input -- --timeout 5000000 "dist-esm/test/{,!(browser)/**/}/*.spec.js"
      ```

  - `test:browser` (runs the browser tests using karma, and concurrently runs the proxy tool in record/playback modes if it is not already active)
    - Example usage
      ```bash
      dev-tool run test:browser
      ```

The `dev-tool about` command will print some information about how to use the command. All commands additionally accept the `--help` argument, which will print information about the usage of that specific command. For example, to show help information for the `resolve` command above, issue the command `dev-tool package resolve --help`.

## Extending the Tool

The source hierarchy matches the command hierarchy. Every sub-command has its own folder and `index.ts` file in `src/commands`, where `src/commands/index.ts` defines the behavior of the root `dev-tool` command, and each subfolder's `index.ts` file describes a nested sub-command. Every leaf node in the command tree ("leaf command") has its own TypeScript file. For example, `src/commands/about.ts` defines the behavior of the `dev-tool about` command, and `src/commands/package/resolve.ts` defines the behavior of the `dev-tool package resolve` command.

### Command Interface

Every command file's exports must implement the `CommandModule` interface defined in `src/util/commandModule.ts`. The interface requires that every command export a constant `commandInfo` that implements the `CommandInfo` interface defined in the same file. A helper command `makeCommandInfo` is provided to assist with the creation of this interface while providing strong type-checking of command-line options. The `CommandInfo` interface specifies the name, description, and options (command-line arguments) of the command. The command module must also export an async handler function as its default export. Two helper functions, `leafCommand` and `subCommand` are provided to assist with development and to provide strong type-checking when
extending dev-tool.

### Creating a new leaf command

To create a new leaf command in one of the existing sub-command, create a new TypeScript file for that command. Make sure that your module exports the required `commandInfo` and default handler function. When creating the `commandInfo` object, use the `makeCommandInfo` helper function. When creating a command, use the `leafCommand` helper to get a strongly-typed `options` parameter for your handler.

As an example, we can create a new `hello-world` command under the `dev-tool package` sub-command. The command will print out a string using the many different logging functions. It will accept an argument `--echo <string here>` that specifies the string to be printed.

`src/commands/package/hello-world.ts`

```typescript
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
// Licensed under the MIT license

import { createPrinter } from "../../util/printer";
import { leafCommand, makeCommandInfo } from "../../framework/command";

const log = createPrinter("hello-world");

export const commandInfo = makeCommandInfo("hello-world", "print a lovely message", {
  echo: {
    kind: "string",
    description: "override the message to be printed",
    default: "Hello world!"
  }
});

export default leafCommand(commandInfo, async (options) => {
  // Demonstrate the colorized command output.
  log("Normal:", options.echo);
  log.success("Success:", options.echo);
  log.info("Info:", options.echo);
  log.warn("Warn:", options.echo);
  log.error("Error:", options.echo);
  log.debug("Debug:", options.echo);

  return true;
});
```

(**Note**: using the `makeCommandInfo` function is required to have strong type-checking on the `options` parameter of the handler. The `options` field of `commandInfo` must have a very strong type, and `makeCommandInfo` takes care of ensuring that the type is as strongly specified as possible.)

As a last step, add a mapping for the `"hello-world"` command to the sub-command map in `src/commands/package/index.ts`. This will allow the command to resolve:

`src/commands/package/index.ts`

```typescript
// ...

export default subCommand(commandInfo, {
  "hello-world": () => import("./hello-world")
  // ... rest of the sub-commands still here
});
```

At this point, the command is ready. When using `leafCommand` or `subCommand`, parsing and handling of arguments, including the `--help` output will be handled automatically by the command infrastructure. Debug output will only be shown if the `DEBUG` environment variable is set. Try it out:

- Use `dev-tool package hello-world` to see the default output of the command
- Use `DEBUG=true dev-tool package hello-world` to see the full debugging output
- Use `dev-tool package hello-world --help` to view the generated help pages and make sure they are correct
- Use `dev-tool package hello-world --echo <another string>` to change the default `"Hello world!"` text to something else.
- Use `dev-tool package --help` to see the `hello-world` command in the help message of its parent command

### Creating a new command with sub-commands

To create a new branching sub-command, create a new folder in the source tree and add an `index.ts` file. The folder should be named the same as the new command. The `subCommand` helper function can assist with creating a branching command.

As an example, we can convert the `hello-world` example above into a branching command `hello` with a single sub-command `world`. Instead of adding it to the `package` sub-command, we will add it to the root `dev-tool` command.

Instead of creating a single file `hello-world.ts`, we will instead create a folder `src/commands/hello` and two ts files: `src/commands/hello/index.ts` and `src/commands/hello/world.ts`. In `src/commands/hello/index.ts`, we can define our new sub-command:

`src/commands/hello/index.ts`

```typescript
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
// Licensed under the MIT license

import { subCommand, makeCommandInfo } from "../../framework/command";

export const commandInfo = makeCommandInfo("hello", "commands for printing some lovely messages");

export default subCommand(commandInfo, {
  world: () => import("./world")
});
```

(**Note**: Since we don't have any arguments or options to add to the sub-command, the `options` argument to `makeCommandInfo` is omitted (since the sub-command just delegates to its child commands, we wouldn't be able to use any options in this parent command anyway).)

This simple file establishes the mapping from the command name `"world"` to our new command module `src/commands/hello/world.ts`. The contents of `world.ts` are very similar to the previous `hello-world.ts` module, but we will change the `name` field of `commandInfo` and the argument to `createPrinter`:

`src/commands/hello/world.ts`

```typescript
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
// Licensed under the MIT license

import { createPrinter } from "../../util/printer";
import { leafCommand, makeCommandInfo } from "../../framework/command";

const log = createPrinter("world");

export const commandInfo = makeCommandInfo("world", "print a lovely message", {
  echo: {
    kind: "string",
    description: "override the message to be printed",
    default: "Hello world!"
  }
});

export default leafCommand(commandInfo, async (options) => {
  // Demonstrate the colorized command output.
  log("Normal:", options.echo);
  log.success("Success:", options.echo);
  log.info("Info:", options.echo);
  log.warn("Warn:", options.echo);
  log.error("Error:", options.echo);
  log.debug("Debug:", options.echo);

  return true;
});
```

The final step is to add a mapping to our new subcommand to the`baseCommands` map root `src/commands/index.ts` file:

`src/commands/index.ts`

```typescript
// ...

/**
 * All of dev-tool's base commands and the modules that define them
 */
export const baseCommands = {
  hello: () => import("./hello")
  // ... all other sub-commands still here
} as const;

// ...
```

(**Note**: If we were adding our `hello` command to another sub-command rather than the root, we would just add it to that sub-command's `index.ts` instead of the root `src/commands/index.ts`, similar to how we added `hello-world` to `src/commands/package/index.ts` in the previous example.)

### Understanding the Options Type

When using `leafCommand`, the handler function takes a value `options` with a type that is generated from the `options` property of the `CommandInfo` object given as the first argument to `leafCommand`. The underlying parsing behavior is implemented by `minimist` and is validated in the `parseOptions` function in `src/util/commandBuilder.ts`.

The structure of the `CommandInfo.options` field is a map from option names to a tagged union that supports three variants (using the "kind" property as the disciminant):

- `"string"` for command-line flags that have a string value (for example, `--directory path/to/directory`)
- `"boolean"` for command-line flags that have a boolean value (for example, `--quiet` with no argument)
- `"multistring"` for command-line flags that have string values and may be specified more than once (for example, `--add-dir path/to/dir1 --add-dir path/to/dir2`)

Each variant supports an optional `shortName` field that specifies a one-letter command alias (e.g. a value of `shortName: "d"` would make `-d` an alias of the `--directory` option above). Each also has an optional `default` parameter to specify the default value should the argument not be specified on the command-line. If no default value is provided, the type of the `options` value passed to the handler will be expanded to include `undefined` as a possible value. Finally, each option has a `description` field that includes the help text shown in the messages produced by `--help`.

### Final Developer Notes

- Using the `subCommand` and `leafCommand` helpers is not required. If a command module exports any function with the signature `(...args: string[]) => Promise<boolean>` as its default export, it will run when the command is invoked and will be given the arguments passed in the parameters. **However**, only `subCommand` and `leafCommand` provide automatic argument parsing and handling of `--help`. The functions used to provide this behavior are located in the `src/util/commandBuilder.ts` module.
- Some additional helper modules can be found in `src/util` such as `resolveProject.ts` which walks up the directory hierarchy and finds the absolute path of the nearest SDK package directory (useful for commands like `samples` which always operate relative to the package directory)
- The tool runs using the `transpileOnly` option in the `ts-node` configuration, meaning it does not perform run-time type-checking. The build step of the package will run type-checking using `tsc`, so to check the tool's code for type errors, simply use `rushx build`.
