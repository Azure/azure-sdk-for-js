    emits: errorReceived
    emits: message

* put chai setup in a common fixture instead of dupicating it in every test file
* expose EventHubClient as azure-eventhubs.Client
* test translateError function in errors.js
* test that onErrorReceived function in EventHubReceiver constructor is only called once in response to an 'errorReceived' event
* all integration tests should have a larger timeout (say, 15s?)--can I add a command line arg to 'npm run' scripts?
