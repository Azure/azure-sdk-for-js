Getting Started: Generate JS SDK with TypeSpec
===========================================================================


# Before you Start

[TypeScript Azure SDK Design Guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/typescript_introduction.html) is the overall design guideline of the client SDK.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 18.x LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Local Clone of Rest API Spec Repo Fork
  - If you don't already have a fork, [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) the [Rest API Spec Repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs).
  - Clone your fork of the repo.
    ```
      git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/azure-rest-api-specs.git
    ```
- Local Clone of JS Language Repo Fork
  - If you don't already have a fork, [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) the [JS Repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js).
  - Clone your fork of the repo.

    ```
      git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/azure-sdk-for-js.git
    ```


# Generate SDK

## Use TypeSpec defined in REST API specifications

It is recommended to configure TypeSpec package on [REST API specifications](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs). Please refer to [these guidelines](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/documentation/typespec-structure-guidelines.md).

### How to configure tspconfig.yaml
You can reference these two config files to configure the Modular or RLC package:
- [Modular tspconfig.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/contosowidgetmanager/Contoso.Management/tspconfig.yaml)
- [RLC tspconfig.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/ai/Face/tspconfig.yaml)

Please make sure `service-dir`, `package-dir`, `packageDetails`, `isModularLibrary`, `generateMetadata`, `flavor`(for typespec-ts) is correctly configured. `experimentalExtensibleEnums`, `enableOperationGroup`, `hierarchyClient` are the optional configs.
If you want to enable sample generation with typespec-ts, you should add 
```
generateSample:true
```
in your tspconfig.yaml


- "parameters.service-dir.default" would be `sdk/<service>`
- "options.@azure-tools/typespec-ts.package-dir" would be `<module>`

SDK module would be generated under the SDK project folder at `sdk/<service>/<module>`.

### Generate Code with code-gen-pipeline tool (recommend)
**Notice** These steps are to generate code using the local spec repo. If you want to generate code with the github url, please refer [Generate Code with tsp-client tool](#generate-code-with-tsp-client-tool)

Install dependencies to use code-gen-pipeline,  
```ps
npm install -g @azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-cli@0.14.1
npm install -g @microsoft/rush@5.92.0
npm install -g @azure-tools/js-sdk-release-tools
```

Create a local json file named generatedInput.json with content similar to that shown below
```
  {
    "dryRun": false,
    "specFolder": <your-local-spec-repo-path>,
    "headSha": <commit-id-you-want-to-generate-from>,
    "repoHttpsUrl": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs",
    "relatedTypeSpecProjectFolder": [
    "specification/SERVICE_DIRECTORY_NAME/PACKAGE_DIRECTORY_NAME/"
    ]
  }
```

Run the command
```
code-gen-pipeline --inputJsonPath=<path-to-generatedInput.json> --outputJsonPath=<path-to-generatedOutput.json> --typespecEmitter=@azure-tools/typespec-ts --local
```

> path-to-generatedOutput.json is the detailed information of generated package, you can ignore it without pipeline. [generateOutput.json](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/documentation/sdkautomation/GenerateOutputSchema.json) is to show us the location of generated artifact and any other messages.

This command will automatically:
1. Generate package code with TypeSpec.
2. Build the package.
3. Generate and run tests (optional, with warnings displayed if they fail).
4. Generate samples, if enabled.
5. Create or update the `CHANGELOG.md`.
6. Bump the version according to the Azure SDK for JS policy.
7. If this is a new package, add it to the project items in `rush.json`.
8. Generate or update `ci.mgmt.yml` or `ci.yml` (if the package is new).


After all the steps finished, you can prepare the release for this generation. See [Prepare Release](#prepare-release)

### Generate Code with tsp-client tool
> To reduce workload and unnecessary mistakes, it is recommended to use the simple method from the previous section. Only if you are clear about what you are doing and the method from the previous section does not meet your needs, should you consider using the method below.

Install `tsp-client` CLI tool

```ps
npm install -g @azure-tools/typespec-client-generator-cli@0.14.1
```

For initial set up, from the root of the SDK repo, call

```
tsp-client init -c <url-to-tspconfig>
```

For updating TypeSpec generated SDK, call below in the SDK module folder (`sdk/<service>/<module>`) where `tsp-location.yaml` exists

```ps
tsp-client update
```

**Notice**
If you use tsp-client to generate code and your generated SDK is new, you need to do two extra things:

**1**: 
You should add your new SDK in [rush.json](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/rush.json).
Here is the example of the config
```
{
  "packageName": <your-package-name>,
  "projectFolder": <sdk/<service>/<module>>,
  "versionPolicyName": <"management"-or-"client">
}
```

**2**: You should add `ci.yml` or `ci.mgmt.yml` under `sdk/<service>/<module`. `ci.yml` is for `Data Plane SDKs` and `ci.mgmt.yml` is for `Mgmt Plane SDKs`. See [Create/Update the ci.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/documentation/steps-after-generations.md#createupdate-the-ciyaml)

#### Build

See [steps-after-generations](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/documentation/steps-after-generations.md).

After all the steps finished, you can prepare the release PullRequest for this generation. See [Prepare Release](#prepare-release)

## Prepare Release

Prepare your SDK for release. The necessary approvals, guidance for testing, documentation, and release pipelines is described in your release plan. More information about the Azure SDK Release Tool is [here](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/plan/release-plan).
