Add the broken links into [eng/ignore-links.txt](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/eng/ignore-links.txt) file to bypass this verification or you could update the broken links to valid ones, see [example pr here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/23429/commits/1a7b74c4bdad27e423a355a4c7f3dde4ac3c83bc).


# Check spelling (cspell)
For new service the error usually happens, Fix spelling in code or in markdown at file [.vscode/cspell.json](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/.vscode/cspell.json). See an example in [devcenter pr](https://github.com/chrissmiller/azure-sdk-for-js/commit/ef18dccae59e98185e3854f8b087230b65735744).

Install [Powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell). Make sure "pwsh" command works at this step (If you follow the above link, "pwsh" is typically added to the system environment variables by default)

If you are from service team, External to azure-sdk, you can follow these steps:
1. To request write access, join the an appropriate team from [this list](https://github.com/orgs/Azure/teams?query=azure-sdk-write-)([same list](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/teams?q=azure-sdk-write-) on MS OpenSource portal) that corresponds with the product or org that you work in. **Be sure to join only one team.**

2. If you don't see your team in the list? Contact **Scott Kurtzeborn** : <scotk@microsoft.com> to create a new one for your service team.

For more details, join [a partner write team](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/onboard/access-teams)

**Note**
For merge permissions to `main` branches, you must be a member of an `azure-sdk-push` team. These permissions are assigned on case-by-case basis only. Reach out to **Scott Kurtzeborn** : <scotk@microsoft.com> if you think that your team needs that permission.
