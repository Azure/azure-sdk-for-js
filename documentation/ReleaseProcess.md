## What We're Doing
Node SDK contains the autogenerated code for different services. In order to make sure that partners can easily keep their copies of Node SDK in sync, we need to finagle things a little as we get ready for release.

## At Code Complete

At code complete, we do the following:

### Node SDK repository
1. Create a new branch off the dev branch named `release-<version>`, where version is the release number for the new release. So as we work towards releasing version 0.6.10, the branch will be "release-0.6.10". All work as part of this release process will be done on this new branch.

2. Update the package.json file with the upcoming version number.

3. Update the change log.


## Stabilization

This is the phase after code complete where everyone's banging on the bits, looking for (and probably finding) bugs.

All issues will be fixed in the release branch of the appropriate repositories. We will decide if we need to rebuild packages and restart test passes on a case-by-case basis.

## Release

After we've completed stabilization, we will do the following steps to do the release.

1. Publish azure SDK from the release branch to npm

## Post Release

After the release is done, we need to:

1. Add a git tag for the release commits in the repo.
2. Merge release branch into master
3. Merge master to dev
4. Delete release branch (we have the tag if we need to go back)

And we're ready for the next go round.
