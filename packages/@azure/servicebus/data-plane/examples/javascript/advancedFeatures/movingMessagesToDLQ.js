/*
    This sample demonstrates scenarios as to how a Service Bus message can be explicitly moved to
    the DLQ. For other implicit ways when Service Bus messages get moved to DLQ, refer to -
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dead-letter-queues

    Run processMessagesInDLQ example after this to see how the messages in DLQ can be reprocessed.
