/*
  This sample demonstrates how to create a namespace using AAD token credentials
  obtained from signing in through your Azure account.

  Setup :
    Please ensure that your Azure Service Bus resource is in US East, US East 2, or West Europe
    region. AAD Role Based Access Control is not supported in other regions yet.

    In the Azure portal, go to your Service Bus resource and click on the Access control (IAM) tab.
    Here, assign "owner" role to your account.
