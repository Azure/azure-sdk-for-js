   * across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
   * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can
   * lead to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second
   * request has a different flight assignment than the first, the experience
   * may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results
   * to that client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the

   * IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header required.

   * and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent
   * user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of

   * include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
   * on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
   * makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the
   * ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
   * across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
   * mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
   * next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that
   * you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
   * response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
   * subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. ATTENTION: You must
