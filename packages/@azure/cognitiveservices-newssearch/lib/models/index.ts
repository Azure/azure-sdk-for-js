  /**
   * @member {string} [clientId] Bing uses this header to provide users with
   * consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features
   * and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic
   * on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user
   * across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple
   * conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can
   * lead to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second
   * request has a different flight assignment than the first, the experience
   * may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results
   * to that client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the
   * user. Bing also uses this header to help improve result rankings by
   * analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance
   * improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs
   * and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API consumer.
   * IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header required.
   * Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same end user
   * and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent
   * user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of
   * results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on the
   * device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not include
   * this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the
   * X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
   * include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
   * on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
   * makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the
   * ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
   * across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
   * mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
   * next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that
   * you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
   * response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
   * subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
   * X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
