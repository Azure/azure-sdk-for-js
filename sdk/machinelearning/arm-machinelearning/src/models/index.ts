 * **AutoArima**: Auto-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model uses time-series data and statistical analysis to interpret the data and make future predictions.
 * This model aims to explain data by using time series data on its past values and uses linear regression to make predictions. \
 * **Prophet**: Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.
 * It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well. \
 * **Naive**: The Naive forecasting model makes predictions by carrying forward the latest target value for each time-series in the training data. \
 * **SeasonalNaive**: The Seasonal Naive forecasting model makes predictions by carrying forward the latest season of target values for each time-series in the training data. \
 * **Average**: The Average forecasting model makes predictions by carrying forward the average of the target values for each time-series in the training data. \
 * **SeasonalAverage**: The Seasonal Average forecasting model makes predictions by carrying forward the average value of the latest season of data for each time-series in the training data. \
 * **ExponentialSmoothing**: Exponential smoothing is a time series forecasting method for univariate data that can be extended to support data with a systematic trend or seasonal component. \
 * **Arimax**: An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variable (ARIMAX) model can be viewed as a multiple regression model with one or more autoregressive (AR) terms and\/or one or more moving average (MA) terms.
 * This method is suitable for forecasting when data is stationary\/non stationary, and multivariate with any type of data pattern, i.e., level\/trend \/seasonality\/cyclicity. \
 * **TCNForecaster**: TCNForecaster: Temporal Convolutional Networks Forecaster. \/\/TODO: Ask forecasting team for brief intro. \
 * **ElasticNet**: Elastic net is a popular type of regularized linear regression that combines two popular penalties, specifically the L1 and L2 penalty functions. \
