## Azure Core Authentication

This library provides core interfaces and helper methods for authenticating with Azure services using Azure Active Directory and other authentication schemes common across the Azure SDK. As a "core" library, it shouldn't need to be added as a dependency to any user code, only other Azure SDK libraries.

## Contributing
