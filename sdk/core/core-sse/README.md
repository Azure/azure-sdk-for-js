# Azure Core SSE library for JavaScript

This is an implementation of server-sent events which work in the browser and Node.js. This library is primarily intended to be used in code generated by [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/Autorest) and [`autorest.typescript`](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.typescript).

## Getting started

### Requirements

### Currently supported environments

- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)
- Latest versions of Safari, Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

See our [support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) for more details.

### Installation

This package is primarily used in generated code and not meant to be consumed directly by end users.

## Key concepts

### EventMessage

A `EventMessage` represents a [message](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format) sent in an event stream.

## Examples

Examples can be found in the `samples` folder.

## Next steps

You can build and run the tests locally by executing `rushx test`. Explore the `test` folder to see advanced usage and behavior of the public classes.
