# Azure Core AMQP client library for AMQP operations

Azure Core AMQP is a library that provides common functionality for **Azure** Javascript
libraries that use [AMQP protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-amqp-protocol-guide)
like the ones for Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Hubs.

## Getting started

### Installation

Install this library using npm as follows:

```bash
npm install @azure/core-amqp
```

### Prerequisites

If you are using this package in a Node.js application, then use Node.js 8.x or higher.

## Key concepts

Some of the key features of Azure Core AMQP library are:

- [Claims based Authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-amqp-protocol-guide#claims-based-authorization)
- Request-Response link for [sending request and receiving response over AMQP](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-amqp-protocol-guide#amqp-management)
- Error translation of AMQP error codes along with errors specific to Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Hubs.
- RetryPolicy for retrying a given operation if a retryable error was encountered.

## Troubleshooting

The core-amqp library depends on the [rhea-promise](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise) library for managing connections, and for sending and receiving events over the [AMQP](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-complete-v1.0-os.pdf) protocol.

### Enable logs

You can set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to one of the following values to enable logging to `stderr`:

- verbose
- info
- warning
- error

You can also set the log level programmatically by importing the
[@azure/logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/logger) package and calling the
`setLogLevel` function with one of the log level values.
For example, when you set the log level to `info`, the logs that are written for levels
`warning` and `error` are also emitted.
This SDK follows the Azure SDK for TypeScript [guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/typescript_implementation.html#general-logging)
when determining which level to log to.

When setting a log level either programmatically or via the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable,
any logs that are written using a log level equal to or less than the one you choose will be emitted.

You can alternatively set the `DEBUG` environment variable to get logs when using this library.
This can be useful if you also want to emit logs from the dependencies `rhea-promise` and `rhea` as well.

**Note:** AZURE_LOG_LEVEL, if set, takes precedence over DEBUG.
Do not specify any `azure` libraries via DEBUG when also specifying
AZURE_LOG_LEVEL or calling setLogLevel.

- Getting only info level debug logs from the core-amqp library.

```bash
export DEBUG=azure:core-amqp:info
```

- Getting debug logs from the core-amqp and the protocol level library.

```bash
export DEBUG=azure:core-amqp:*,rhea*
```

- If you are **not interested in viewing the raw event data** (which consumes a large amount of console/disk space) then you can set the `DEBUG` environment variable as follows:

```bash
export DEBUG=azure:core-amqp:*,rhea*,-rhea:raw,-rhea:message
```

- If you are interested only in **errors** and SDK **warnings**, then you can set the `DEBUG` environment variable as follows:

```bash
export DEBUG=azure:core-amqp:(error|warning),rhea-promise:error,rhea:events,rhea:frames,rhea:io,rhea:flow
```

#### Logging to a file

- Set the `DEBUG` environment variable as shown above and then run your test script as follows:
  - Logging statements from you test script go to `out.log` and logging statement from the sdk go to `debug.log`.
    ```bash
    node your-test-script.js > out.log 2>debug.log
    ```
  - Logging statements from your test script and the sdk go to the same file `out.log` by redirecting stderr to stdout (&1), and then redirect stdout to a file:
    ```bash
    node your-test-script.js >out.log 2>&1
    ```
  - Logging statements from your test script and the sdk go to the same file `out.log`.
    ```bash
    node your-test-script.js &> out.log
    ```
