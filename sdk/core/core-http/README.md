# Azure Core HTTP client library for JavaScript

This is the core HTTP pipeline for Azure SDK JavaScript libraries which work in the browser and Node.js. This library is primarily intended to be used in code generated by [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/Autorest) and [`autorest.typescript`](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.typescript).

## Getting started

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version > 8.x
- Typescript compiler

```shell
npm install -g typescript
```

### Installation

This package is not meant to be consumed directly by end users.

## Key concepts

You can find an explanation of how this repository's code works by going to our [architecture overview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/sdk/core/core-http/docs/architectureOverview.md).

## Examples

Examples can be found in the `samples` folder.

## Next steps

First obtain an access token to the management service used in the sample code

One easy way to get an access token is using [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest)

1. Sign in
```shell
az login
```
2. Select the subscription to use
```shell
az account set -s <subscription id>
```
3. Obtain an access token
```shell
az account get-access-token --resource=https://management.azure.com
```

### Node.js

- Set environment variables used in the sample code

on \*Nix/MacOS
```shell
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<subscription id>
export ACCESS_TOKEN=<access token>
```
or on Windows,

```shell
set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<subscription id>
set ACCESS_TOKEN=<access token>
```

- Change directory to samples folder, compile the TypeScript code, then run the sample

```
cd samples
tsc node-sample.ts
node node-sample.js
```

### Browser

- Set values of `subscriptionId` and `token` variable in `samples/index.js`
- Follow the instructions of [JavaScript Bundling Guide using Parcel](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/documentation/Bundling.md#using-parcel) to build and run the code in the browser.
