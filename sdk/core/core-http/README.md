# Azure Core HTTP client library for JavaScript

This is the core HTTP pipeline for Azure SDK JavaScript libraries which work in the browser and Node.js. This library is primarily intended to be used in code generated by [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/Autorest) and [`autorest.typescript`](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.typescript).

## Getting started

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version > 8.x
- npm install -g typescript

### Installation

This package is not meant to be consumed directly by end users.

## Key concepts

You can find an explanation of how this repository's code works by going to our [architecture overview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/sdk/core/core-http/docs/architectureOverview.md).

## Examples

Examples can be found in the `samples` folder.

## Next steps

First obtain an access token to the management service used in the sample code

One easy way to get the token using Azure CLI (https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest)

1. `az login` using the above subscription
2. `az account set -s <subscription id>`
3. `az account get-access-token --resource=https://management.azure.com`

### Node.js

- Set the subscriptionId and token environment variables
- Change directory to samples folder `cd samples`
- Compile the TypeScript code `tsc node-sample.ts`
- Run `node node-sample.js`

### In the browser

- Change directory to samples folder `cd samples`
- Set the subscriptionId and token in `index.js`
- Follow the guide at https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/documentation/Bundling.md#using-parcel
- Open index.html file in the browser. It should show the response from GET request on the storage account. From Chrome type Ctrl + Shift + I and you can see the logs in console.
