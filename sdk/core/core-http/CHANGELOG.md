# Release History

## 2.2.0 (2021-09-02)

### Bugs Fixed

- `tracingPolicy` will no longer propagate tracing errors to the caller, and such errors will be logged instead and the operation does not get interrupted. [PR #16916](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/16916)

## 2.1.0 (2021-07-22)

### Features Added

- `tracingPolicy` will no longer inject invalid traceparent headers if an incorrect tracer implementation is used.

## 1.2.2 (2021-01-07)

- Cache the default `HttpClient` used when one isn't passed in to `ServiceClient`. This means that for most packages we will only create a single `HttpClient`, which will improve platform resource usage by reducing overhead. [PR 12966](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/12966)

## 1.2.1 (2020-12-09)

## 1.1.8 (2020-09-08)

- `URLQuery` parsing now accepts `=` in query parameter values and no longer drops such query parameter name/value pairs. This fixes [issue 11014](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/11014)

## 1.1.7 (2020-09-02)

- `BearerTokenAuthenticationPolicy` now starts trying to refresh the token 30 seconds before the token expires. It will only try to refresh said token on each request when refreshing is not in progress. In the mean time, requests will use the existing token. This fixes [issue 10084](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/10084).
- Un-export the `{...}Policy` classes that were meant to be internal to `@azure/core-http`. [PR 10738](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/10738)

- Updated to use OpenTelemetry 0.6.1 via `@azure/core-tracing`.

## 1.1.0 (2020-03-31)

- A new interface `WebResourceLike` was introduced to avoid a direct dependency on the class `WebResource` in public interfaces. `HttpHeadersLike` was also added to replace references to `HttpHeaders`. This should improve cross-version compatibility for core-http. [PR #7873](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/7873)

- Add support to disable response decompression in `node-fetch` Http client. [PR #7878](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/7878)

## 1.0.4 (2020-03-03)

- When an operation times out based on the `timeout` configured in the `OperationRequestOptions`, it gets terminated with an error. In this update, the error that is thrown in browser for such cases is updated to match what is thrown in node i.e an `AbortError` is thrown instead of the previous `RestError`. [PR #7159](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/7159)
- Support for username and password in the proxy url [PR #7211](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/7211)

## 1.0.3 (2020-01-02)

- Added `x-ms-useragent` to the list of allowed headers in request logs.
- Fix issue of data being pushed twice when reporting progress ([PR #6427](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/6427))
- Move `getDefaultProxySettings()` calls into `proxyPolicy` so that libraries that don't use the PipelineOptions or createDefaultRequestPolicyFactories from core-http can use this behavior without duplicating code. ([PR #6478](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/6478))
- Fix tracingPolicy() to set standard span attributes ([PR #6565](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/6565)). Now the following are set correctly for the spans
  - `http.method`
  - `http.url`
  - `http.user_agent`
  - `http.status_code`
  - `requestId`
  - `serviceRequestId`
  - `kind` = Client
  - span name: URI path

## 1.0.2 (2019-12-02)

- Updated to use OpenTelemetry 0.2 via `@azure/core-tracing`

## 1.0.0 (2019-10-29)

- This release marks the general availability of the `@azure/core-http` package.
- Removed the browser bundle. A browser-compatible library can still be created through the use of a bundler such as Rollup, Webpack, or Parcel.
  ([#5860](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/5860))

## 1.0.0-preview.6 (2019-10-22)

- Introduced a HTTP pipeline configuration type, `PipelineOptions`, which makes it easier to configure common settings for API requests. This is now the options type used in the `@azure/keyvault-*` data plane libraries.
- Support for HTTP request logging has been redesigned to use `@azure/logger`; use`AZURE_LOG_LEVEL="info"` to see full request/response logs when running in Node.js. In the browser, you can import `setLogLevel` from `@azure/logger` to change the log level; logs will then be written to the browser console.
- Removed error type `ResponseBodyNotFoundError` that was introduced in the previous preview. Use cases for it were removed.
- Fixed an issue where error response details were not being deserialized correctly when the default mapper is used.
- In Node.js, HTTP agents configured for proxy or keepAlive are now reused across requests. This resolves a memory leak reported in [#4964](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/4964).
- Fixes a memory leak issue resulting from event listeners not being removed from abortSignals.
- Cancelling an operation using an `abortSignal` will now throw an `AbortError`.
  The `name` property on the error will match "AbortError".

## 1.0.0-preview.4 (2019-10-07)

- No longer re-exports `@azure/core-tracing`. To enable tracing, call `setTracer` from `@azure/core-tracing` directly.
  ([PR #5389](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/5389))
- Report upload/download progress only after the first data chunk is received
  ([PR #5298](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/5298))
- Added new error type `ResponseBodyNotFoundError` for cases when the response body is unexpectedly empty.
  ([PR #5369](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/5369))
- Temporary fix for a memory leak issue resulting from creating new agents every time WebResource is cloned.
  ([PR #5396](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/5396))

## 1.0.0-preview.3 (2019-09-09)

- Syncs changes from `@azure/ms-rest-js` to `@azure/core-http`.
  ([PR #4756](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/4756)).
  - Updates HTTP clients to `fetch` and `node-fetch` for the browser and node.js respectively.
- Reintroduces `ServiceClientCredentials` type to `credentials` parameter of `ServiceClient`
  ([PR #4773](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/4773)).
- Updates types for better compatibility with TypeScript 3.6.x.
  ([PR #4928](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/4928)).
- Adds `TracingPolicy` to support setting `traceparent` and `tracestate` headers
  when setting spans in operation as per the [trace context HTTP headers format](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#trace-context-http-headers-format).
  ([PR #4712](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/4712)).
- Adds `text/plain` as an accepted MIME type for JSON output.
  ([PR #4975](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/4975)).
- Exposes `ProxySettings` type. ([PR #5043](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/5043)).
- Fixes bug where `WebResource.clone` would not copy `proxySettings` or `keepAlive` settings.
  ([PR #5047](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/5047)).

## 1.0.0-preview.2 (2019-08-05)

- Removed `ServiceClientCredentials` type from `credentials` parameter of `ServiceClient` ([PR #4367](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/4367)). Credential implementations are now standardized on `@azure/core-auth`'s `TokenCredential` interface and provided by `@azure/identity`.
- Added an `AccessTokenCache` so that access tokens can be cached across pipeline instances ([PR #4174](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/4174)).
- Fixed the issue preventing `ServiceClient` from correctly setting the scope's resource URI when creating a `BearerTokenAuthenticationPolicy` ([PR #4335](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/4335)).
- Migrated over `AxiosHttpClient` fixes from `@azure/ms-rest-js` ([PR #4106](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/4106)).

## 1.0.0-preview.1 (2019-06-25)

- Forked `@azure/ms-rest-js` to `@azure/core-http` to form the base HTTP pipeline of the Azure SDK TypeScript/JavaScript libraries.
- Added `TokenCredential` to define a simple interface for credentials that provided bearer tokens
- Added `BearerTokenAuthenticationPolicy` which can use a `TokenCredential` implementation to perform bearer token authentication against Azure services
