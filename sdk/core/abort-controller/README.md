# Azure Abort Controller library for JS

The `@azure/abort-controller` package provides `AbortController` and `AbortSignal` classes that are compatible
with the `AbortController` built into modern browsers and the `AbortSignal` used by `fetch`.
These classes are provided for use with APIs in the Azure SDK for JavaScript that accept an `AbortSignalLike`
parameter to cancel an operation.

## Getting started

### Installation

- Installing this library

```
npm install @azure/abort-controller
```

## Key Concepts

Use the `AbortController` to create an `AbortSignal` which can then be passed to Azure SDK operations to cancel
pending work. The `AbortSignal` can be accessed via the `signal` property on an instantiated `AbortController`.
An `AbortSignal` can also be returned directly from a static method, e.g. `AbortController.timeout(100)`.
that is cancelled after 100 milliseconds.

Calling `abort()` on the instantiated `AbortController` invokes the regiestered `abort`
event listeners on the associated `AbortSignal`.
Any subsequent calls to `abort()` on the same controller will have no effect.

The `AbortSignal.none` static property returns an `AbortSignal` that can not be aborted.

`AbortSignals` can also be linked so that when `abort()` is called on parent signal,
it also fires on all linked signals.
This linkage is one-way, meaning that a parent signal can affect a linked signal, but not the other way around.
To link `AbortSignals` together, pass in the parent signals to the `AbortController` constructor.

## Examples

### Example 1 - basic usage

```js
import { AbortController } from "@azure/abort-controller";

const controller = new AbortController();
doAsyncWork({ abortSignal: controller.signal });

// at some point later
controller.abort();
```

### Example 2 - Aborting with timeout

```js
import { AbortController } from "@azure/abort-controller";

const signal = AbortController.timeout(1000);
doAsyncWork({ abortSignal: signal });
```

### Example 3 - Aborting sub-tasks

```js
import { AbortController } from "@azure/abort-controller";

const allTasksController = new AbortController();

const subTask1 = new AbortController(allTasksController.signal);
const subtask2 = new AbortController(allTasksController.signal);

allTasksController.abort(); // aborts allTasksSignal, subTask1, subTask2
subTask1.abort(); // aborts only subTask1
```

### Example 4 - Aborting with parent signal or timeout

```js
import { AbortController } from "@azure/abort-controller";

const allTasksController = new AbortController();

// create a subtask controller that can be aborted manually,
// or when either the parent task aborts or the timeout is reached.
const subTask = new AbortController(allTasksController.signal, AbortController.timeout(100));

allTasksController.abort(); // aborts allTasksSignal, subTask
subTask.abort(); // aborts only subTask
```
