# Azure Core ARM client library for JavaScript

This is an Azure-specific layer for the core HTTP pipeline of Azure SDK JavaScript libraries which work in the browser and Node.js. This library is primarily intended to be used in code generated by [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/Autorest) and [`autorest.typescript`](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.typescript).

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js version > 6.x
- npm install -g typescript

### Installation

- After cloning the repo, execute `npm install`

## Key concepts

This library provides a `ServiceClient` subclass called `AzureServiceClient` which adds some Azure-specific behavior such as the management of long-running operations.  For more information on the design of the underlying library `@azure/core-http`, consult the [architecture overview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/sdk/core/core-http/docs/architectureOverview.md).

## Examples

Examples can be found in the `samples` folder.

## Next steps

### Node.js

- Set the subscriptionId and token
- Run `node samples/node-sample.js`

### In the browser

- Set the subscriptionId and token and then run
- Open index.html file in the browser. It should show the response from GET request on the storage account. From Chrome type Ctrl + Shift + I and you can see the logs in console.
