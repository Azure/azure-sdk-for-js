# Azure Core Paging client library for JS

This library provides core types for paging async iterable iterators.

## Getting started

### Installation

If using this as part of another project in the [azure-sdk-for-js](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js) repo,
then run `rush install` after cloning the repo.

Otherwise, use npm to install this package in your application as follows

```javascript
npm install @azure/core-paging
```

## Key concepts

You can find an explanation of how this repository's code works by going to our [architecture overview](https://github.com/Azure/ms-rest-js/blob/master/docs/architectureOverview.md).

## Examples

Example of building with the types:

```typescript
  public listSecrets(
    options?: ListSecretsOptions
  ): PagedAsyncIterableIterator<SecretAttributes> {
    const iter = this.listSecretsAll(options);
    return {
      async next() {
        const item = (await iter.next()).value;
        return item ? { done: false, value: item } : { done: true, value: undefined };
      },
      [Symbol.asyncIterator]() { return this; },
      byPage: (settings: PageSettings = {}) => this.listSecretsPage(settings, options),
    };
  }
```

And using the types:

```
  for await (let page of client.listSecrets().byPage({ pageSize: 2 })) {
    for (const secret of page) {
      console.log("secret: ", secret);
    }
  }
```

## Next steps

Try out this package in your application when dealing with async iterable iterators and provide feedback!
