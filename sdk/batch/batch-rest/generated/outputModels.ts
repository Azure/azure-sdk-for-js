 * Tasks). When a Job Manager Task fails and needs to be restarted, the system
 * tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle Compute
 * Nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running Tasks in the Pool
 * and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager Task to

 * example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 Job needs to be restarted, it will
 * not displace Tasks of a priority 1 Job. Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery
 * operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of recovery operations include (but

 * disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are
 * independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the
 * maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may
 * occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need
