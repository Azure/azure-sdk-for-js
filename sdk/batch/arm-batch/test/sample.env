Test Configuration Instructions
================================


In Live Mode
-------------

- First create a Service Principal for the subscription you wish to test against.
  Follow the instructions here on creating a Service Principal using the Azure CLI:
  https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node/blob/master/Documentation/Authentication.md

- Once the Service Principal is configured, set the following env variables.

    AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID:  Azure subscription GUID
    AZURE_CLIENT_ID: The Service Principal Application ID
    AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: The password configured for the AAD Application
    AZURE_TENANT_ID: Tenant (e.g. microsoft.com)
    
- The tests are configured by default to run with in japaneast, using a resource group of
  'default-azurebatch-japaneast'. To change this location set:
    
    AZURE_TEST_LOCATION: Location name
    
- The tests require a storage account to be configured. Using the CLI:
    >> az storage account create -n <name> -l <location> -g <resource group> --sku Standard_LRS
    
   The tests have been configured against a <storage account name> of nodesdkteststorage. If you have set up
   a different name, then set:
   
    AZURE_AUTOSTORAGE: Your storage account name
