# Azure Example client library for JavaScript

This project is used as part of the API Implementation tutorial. It is intended to give you a good idea of what it's like to build a client library for an Azure service.

## Getting started

### Currently supported environments

- Node.js version 8.x or higher

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].

Usually you'd put a shell command for provisioning the necessary Azure services here.

### Install the `@azure/implementation-tutorial` package

Install the Example client library for JavaScript with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @azure/implementation-tutorial
```

### Further examples

Top-level examples usually include things like creating and authenticating the main Client. If your service supports multiple means of authenticating (e.g. key-based and Azure Active Directory) you can give a separate example of each.

## Key concepts

### ExampleClient

Describe your primary client here. Talk about what operations it can do and when a developer would want to use it.

### Additional Examples

Create a section for each top-level service concept you want to explain.

## Examples

### First Example

Create several code examples for how someone would use your library to accomplish a common task with the service.

## Troubleshooting

### Enable logs

You can set the following environment variable to see debug logs when using this library.

- Getting debug logs from the Azure TextAnalytics client library

```bash
export DEBUG=azure*
```
