# Azure FarmBeats REST client library for JavaScript

FarmBeats is a B2B PaaS offering from Microsoft that makes it easy for AgriFood companies to build intelligent digital agriculture solutions on Azure. FarmBeats allows users to acquire, aggregate, and process agricultural data from various sources (farm equipment, weather, satellite) without the need to invest in deep data engineering resources.  Customers can build SaaS solutions on top of FarmBeats and leverage first class support for model building to generate insights at scale.

Use FarmBeats client library for JavaScript to do the following.

- Create & update farmers, farms, fields, seasonal fields and boundaries.
- Ingest satellite and weather data for areas of interest.
- Ingest farm operations data covering tilling, planting, harvesting and application of farm inputs.

**Please rely heavily on the [service's documentation][product_documentation] and our [REST client docs][rest_client] to use this library**

## Getting started

### Currently supported environments

- Node.js version 14.x.x or higher

### Prerequisites

- You must have an [Azure subscription][azure_subscription].
- AgriFood (FarmBeats) resource - [Install FarmBeats][install_farmbeats]

### Install the `@azure-rest/agrifood-farming` package

Install the Azure FarmBeats rest client library for JavaScript with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @azure-rest/agrifood-farming
```

### Create and authenticate a `FarmBeats` REST Client

To use an [Azure Active Directory (AAD) token credential][authenticate_with_token],
provide an instance of the desired credential type obtained from the
[@azure/identity][azure_identity_credentials] library.

To authenticate with AAD, you must first `npm` install [`@azure/identity`][azure_identity_npm].

After setup, you can choose which type of [credential][azure_identity_credentials] from `@azure/identity` to use.
As an example, [DefaultAzureCredential][default_azure_credential]
can be used to authenticate the client:

Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as environment variables:
AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

Use the returned token credential to authenticate the client:

```typescript
import FarmBeats from "@azure-rest/agrifood-farming";
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";

const client = FarmBeats(
  "https://<farmbeats resource name>.farmbeats.azure.net",
  new DefaultAzureCredential()
);
```

## Key concepts

### REST Client

This client is one of our REST clients. We highly recommend you read how to use a REST client [here][rest_client].

### [Farm Hierarchy][farm_hierarchy]

Farm hierarchy is a collection of below entities.

- Farmer - is the custodian of all the agronomic data.
- Farm - is a logical collection of fields and/or seasonal fields. They do not have any area associated with them.
- Field - is a multi-polygon area. This is expected to be stable across seasons.
- Seasonal field - is a multi-polygon area. To define a seasonal boundary we need the details of area (boundary), time (season) and crop. New seasonal fields are expected to be created for every growing season.
- Boundary - is the actual multi-polygon area expressed as a geometry (in geojson). It is normally associated with a field or a seasonal field. Satellite, weather and farm operations data is linked to a boundary.
- Cascade delete - Agronomic data is stored hierarchically with farmer as the root. The hierarchy includes Farmer -> Farms -> Fields -> Seasonal Fields -> Boundaries -> Associated data (satellite, weather, farm operations). Cascade delete refers to the process of deleting any node and its subtree.

### [Scenes][scenes]

Scenes refers to images normally ingested using satellite APIs. This includes raw bands and derived bands (Ex: NDVI). Scenes may also include spatial outputs of an inference or AI/ML model (Ex: LAI).

### [Farm Operations][farm_operations_docs]

Fam operations includes details pertaining to tilling, planting, application of pesticides & nutrients, and harvesting. This can either be manually pushed into FarmBeats using APIs or the same information can be pulled from farm equipment service providers like John Deere.

## Examples

### Create a Farmer

Once you have authenticated and created the client object as shown in the [Authenticate the client](#create-and-authenticate-a-farmbeats-rest-client)
section, you can create a farmer within the FarmBeats resource like this:

```typescript
import FarmBeats from "@azure-rest/agrifood-farming";
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";

const client = FarmBeats(
  "https://<farmbeats resource name>.farmbeats.azure.net",
  new DefaultAzureCredential()
);

const farmerId = "test_farmer";
const result = await client.path("/farmers/{farmerId}", farmerId).patch({
  body: {
    name: "Contoso Farmer",
    description: "Your custom farmer description here",
    status: "Active",
    properties: { foo: "bar", "numeric one": 1, "1": "numeric key" },
  },
  // Set the content-type of the request
  contentType: "application/merge-patch+json",
});

if (result.status !== "200" && result.status !== "201") {
  throw result.body.error;
}

console.log(`Created Farmer: ${result.body.name}`);
```

### List Farmers

```typescript
import FarmBeats from "@azure-rest/agrifood-farming";
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";

const client = FarmBeats(
  "https://<farmbeats resource name>.farmbeats.azure.net",
  new DefaultAzureCredential()
);

const result = await client.path("/farmers").get();

if (result.status !== "200") {
  throw result.body.error?.message;
}

let farmers: Farmer[] = result.body.value ?? [];
let skipToken = result.body.skipToken;

// Farmer results may be paginated. In case there are more than one page of farmers
// the service would return a skipToken that can be used for subsequent request to get
// the next page of farmers. Here we'll keep calling until the service stops returning a
// skip token which means that there are no more pages.
while (skipToken) {
  const page = await client.path("/farmers").get({ queryParameters: { $skipToken: skipToken } });
  if (page.status !== "200") {
    throw page.body.error;
  }

  farmers.concat(page.body.value ?? []);
  skipToken = page.body.skipToken;
}

// Lof each farmer id
farmers.forEach((farmer) => {
  console.log(farmer.id);
});
```

For additional samples, please refer to the [samples folder][samples_folder]

## Troubleshooting

### Logging

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling `setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```javascript
import { setLogLevel } from "@azure/logger";

setLogLevel("info");
```

For more detailed instructions on how to enable logs, you can look at the [@azure/logger package docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/core/logger).
