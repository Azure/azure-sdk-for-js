/**
 * This sample demonstrates how to Purges data in an Application Insights component by a set of user-defined filters.




In order to manage system resources, purge requests are throttled at 50 requests per hour. You should batch the execution of purge requests by sending a single command whose predicate includes all user identities that require purging. Use the in operator to specify multiple identities. You should run the query prior to using for a purge request to verify that the results are expected.
Note: this operation is intended for Classic resources, for  workspace-based Application Insights resource please run purge operation (directly on the workspace)(  https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/loganalytics/workspace-purge/purge) , scoped to specific resource id.
