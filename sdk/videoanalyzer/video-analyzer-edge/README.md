# Azure Video Analyzer Edge client library for JavaScript

Azure Video Analyzer on IoT Edge provides a platform to build intelligent video applications that span the edge and the cloud. The platform offers the capability to capture, record, and analyze live video along with publishing the results, video and video analytics, to Azure services in the cloud or the edge. It is designed to be an extensible platform, enabling you to connect different video analysis edge modules (such as Cognitive services containers, custom edge modules built by you with open-source machine learning models or custom models trained with your own data) to it and use them to analyze live video without worrying about the complexity of building and running a live video pipeline.

Use the client library for Video Analyzer on IoT Edge to:

- Simplify interactions with the [Microsoft Azure IoT SDKs](https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdks)
- Programmatically construct pipeline topologies and live pipelines

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Video Analyzer client library for Typescript with npm:

```bash
npm install @azure/video-analyzer-edge
```

### Prerequisites

- TypeScript v3.6.
- You need an active [Azure subscription][azure_sub], and a IoT device connection string to use this package.
- To interact with Azure IoT Hub you will need to run `npm install azure-iothub`
- You will need to use the version of the SDK that corresponds to the version of the Video Analyzer Edge module you are using.

  | SDK          | Video Analyzer Edge Module |
  | ------------ | -------------------------- |
  | 1.0.0-beta.1 | 1.0                        |

### Creating a pipeline topology and making requests

Please visit the [Examples](#examples) for starter code.

## Key concepts

### Pipeline Topology vs Pipeline Instance

A _pipeline topology_ is a blueprint or template for instantiating live pipelines. It defines the parameters of the pipeline using placeholders as values for them. A _live pipeline_ references a pipeline topology and specifies the parameters. This way you are able to have multiple live pipelines referencing the same topology but with different values for parameters. For more information please visit [pipeline topologies and live pipelines][doc_pipelines].

## Examples

### Creating a pipeline topology

To create a pipeline topology you need to define parameters, sources, and sinks.

```typescript
const rtspSource: RtspSource = {
    name: "rtspSource",
    endpoint: {
      url: "${rtspUrl}",
      "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.UnsecuredEndpoint",
      credentials: {
        username: "${rtspUserName}",
        password: "${rtspPassword}",
        "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.UsernamePasswordCredentials"
      }
    } as UnsecuredEndpoint,
    "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.RtspSource"
  };

  const nodeInput: NodeInput = {
    nodeName: "rtspSource"
  };

  const msgSink: IotHubMessageSink = {
    name: "msgSink",
    inputs: [nodeInput],
    hubOutputName: "${hubSinkOutputName}",
    "@type": "#Microsoft.VideoAnalyzer.IotHubMessageSink"
  };

  const pipelineTopology: PipelineTopology = {
    name: "jsTestTopology",
    properties: {
      description: "description for jsTestTopology",
      parameters: [
        { name: "rtspUserName", type: "String", default: "dummyUsername" },
        { name: "rtspPassword", type: "SecretString", default: "dummyPassword" },
        { name: "rtspUrl", type: "String" }
        { name: "hubSinkOutputName", type: "String" }
      ],
      sources: [rtspSource],
      sinks: [msgSink]
    }
  };

```

### Creating a live pipeline

To create a live pipeline instance, you need to have an existing pipeline topology.

```typescript
const livePipeline: LivePipeline = {
  name: pipelineTopologyName,
  properties: {
    description: "description for jsTestLivePipeline",
    topologyName: "jsTestTopology",
    parameters: [{ name: "rtspUrl", value: "rtsp://sample.com" }]
  }
};
```

### Invoking a pipeline method request

To create a pipeline method request you will need to get your deviceId and moduleId from your Azure IoT hub.

```typescript
import { createRequest } from "@azure/video-analyzer-edge";
import { Client } from "azure-iothub";

const deviceId = "lva-sample-device";
const moduleId = "mediaEdge";
const connectionString = "connectionString";
const iotHubClient = Client.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
const pipelineTopologySetRequest = createRequest("pipelineTopologySet", pipelineTopology);
const setPipelineTopResponse = await iotHubClient.invokeDeviceMethod(deviceId, moduleId, {
  methodName: pipelineTopologySetRequest.methodName,
  payload: pipelineTopologySetRequest.payload
});
```
