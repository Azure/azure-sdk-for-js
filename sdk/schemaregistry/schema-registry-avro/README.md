# Azure Schema Registry Avro Serializer client library for JavaScript

Azure Schema Registry is a schema repository service hosted by Azure Event Hubs,
providing schema storage, versioning, and management. This package provides an
Avro serializer capable of serializing and deserializing payloads containing
Avro-serialized data.

## Getting started

- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub]
- An existing [Schema Registry resource](https://aka.ms/schemaregistry)

### Install the `@azure/schema-registry-avro` package

Install the Azure Text Analytics client library for JavaScript with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @azure/schema-registry-avro
```

## Key concepts

### AvroSerializer

Provides API to serialize to and deserialize from Avro Binary Encoding wrapped in a message
with a content type field containing the schema ID. Uses
`SchemaRegistryClient` from the [@azure/schema-registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/schema-registry) package
to get schema IDs from schema definition or vice versa. The provided API has internal cache to avoid calling the schema registry service when possible.

### Messages

By default, the serializer will create messages structured as follows:

- `data`: a byte array containing data in the Avro Binary Encoding. Note that it
  is NOT Avro Object Container File. The latter includes the schema and creating
  it defeats the purpose of using this serializer to move the schema out of the
  message payload and into the schema registry.

- `contentType`: a string of the following format `avro/binary+<Schema ID>` where
  the `avro/binary` part signals that this message has an Avro-serialized payload
  and the `<Schema Id>` part is the Schema ID the Schema Registry service assigned
  to the schema used to serialize this payload.

Not all messaging services are supporting the same message structure. To enable
integration with such services, the serializer can act on custom message structures
by setting the `messageAdapter` option in the constructor with a corresponding
message producer and consumer. Azure messaging client libraries export default
adapters for their message types.

## Examples

### Serialize and deserialize an `@azure/event-hubs`'s `EventData`

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { createEventDataAdapter } = require("@azure/event-hubs");
const { SchemaRegistryClient } = require("@azure/schema-registry");
const { AvroSerializer } = require("@azure/schema-registry-avro");

const client = new SchemaRegistryClient(
  "<fully qualified namespace>",
  new DefaultAzureCredential()
);
const serializer = new AvroSerializer(client, {
  groupName: "<group>",
  messageAdapter: createEventDataAdapter(),
});

// Example Avro schema
const schema = JSON.stringify({
  type: "record",
  name: "Rating",
  namespace: "my.example",
  fields: [{ name: "score", type: "int" }],
});

// Example value that matches the Avro schema above
const value = { score: 42 };

// Serialize value to a message
const message = await serializer.serialize(value, schema);

// Deserialize a message to value
const deserializedValue = await serializer.deserialize(message);
```

## Troubleshooting

The Avro serializer communicates with the [Schema Registry][schema_registry] service as needed to register or query schemas and those service calls could throw a [RestError][resterror]. Furthermore, errors of type `Error` will be thrown when serialization or deserialization fails. The `cause` property will contain the underlying error that was thrown from the Avro implementation library.

### Logging

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to
see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment
variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling
`setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```javascript
const { setLogLevel } = require("@azure/logger");

setLogLevel("info");
```
