# Azure Schema Registry Json Serializer client library for JavaScript

Azure Schema Registry is a schema repository service hosted by Azure Event Hubs,
providing schema storage, versioning, and management. This package provides an
Json serializer capable of serializing and deserializing payloads containing
Json-serialized data.

## Getting started

- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub]
- An existing [Schema Registry resource](https://aka.ms/schemaregistry)

### Install the `@azure/schema-registry-json` package

Install the Azure Text Analytics client library for JavaScript with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @azure/schema-registry-json
```

## Key concepts

### JsonSerializer

Provides API to serialize to and deserialize from JSON wrapped in a message
with a content type field containing the schema ID. Uses
`SchemaRegistryClient` from the [@azure/schema-registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/schema-registry) package
to get schema IDs from schema definition or vice versa. The provided API has internal cache to avoid calling the schema registry service when possible.

### Messages

By default, the serializer will create messages structured as follows:

- `data`: a byte array containing JSON data.

- `contentType`: a string of the following format `application/json+<Schema ID>` where
  the `application/json` part signals that this message has a Json-serialized payload
  and the `<Schema Id>` part is the Schema ID the Schema Registry service assigned
  to the schema used to serialize this payload.

Not all messaging services are supporting the same message structure. To enable
integration with such services, the serializer can act on custom message structures
by setting the `messageAdapter` option in the constructor with a corresponding
message producer and consumer. Azure messaging client libraries export default
adapters for their message types.

## Examples

### Serialize and deserialize an `@azure/event-hubs`'s `EventData`

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { createEventDataAdapter } = require("@azure/event-hubs");
const { SchemaRegistryClient } = require("@azure/schema-registry");
const { JsonSerializer } = require("@azure/schema-registry-json");

const client = new SchemaRegistryClient(
  "<fully qualified namespace>",
  new DefaultAzureCredential()
);
const serializer = new JsonSerializer(client, {
  groupName: "<group>",
  messageAdapter: createEventDataAdapter(),
});

// Example Json schema
const schema = JSON.stringify({  
  $schema: "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  $id: "person",
  title: "Student",
  description: "A student in the class",
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    name: {
      type: "string",
      description: "The name of the student",
    },
  },
  required: ["name"]
});

// Example value that matches the Json schema above
const value = { name: "Bob" };

// Serialize value to a message
const message = await serializer.serialize(value, schema);

// Deserialize a message to value
const deserializedValue = await serializer.deserialize(message);
```

The serializer doesn't check whether the deserialized value matches the schema 
but provides an option to implement such validation. The application can pass a 
validation callback function as one of the options to the deserialize method where schema validation can be implemented.
To see how the validation might be implemented, please checkout the [`schemaRegistryJsonWithValidation`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/schemaregistry/schema-registry-json/samples-dev/schemaRegistryJsonWithValidation.ts)
sample.

## Troubleshooting

The Json serializer communicates with the [Schema Registry][schema_registry] service as needed to register or query schemas and those service calls could throw a [RestError][resterror]. Furthermore, errors of type `Error` will be thrown when serialization or deserialization fails. The `cause` property will contain the underlying error that was thrown from the JSON parser.

### Logging

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to
see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment
variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling
`setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```javascript
const { setLogLevel } = require("@azure/logger");

setLogLevel("info");
```
