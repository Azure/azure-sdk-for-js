# Azure Cognitive Services Health Insights Radiology Insights REST client library for JavaScript

[Health Insights][health_insights] is an Azure Applied AI Service built with the Azure Cognitive Services Framework, that leverages multiple Cognitive Services, Healthcare API services and other Azure resources.

[Radiology Insights][radiology_insights_docs] is a model that aims to provide quality checks as feedback on errors and inconsistencies (mismatches) and ensures critical findings are identified and communicated using the full context of the report. Follow-up recommendations and clinical findings with measurements (sizes) documented by the radiologist are also identified.

**Please rely heavily on our [REST client docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/documentation/rest-clients.md) to use this library**

## Getting started

### Currently supported environments

- LTS versions of Node.js

### Prerequisites

- LTS versions of Node.js
- You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to use this package.
- An existing Cognitive Services Health Insights instance.

### Install the `@azure-rest/health-insights-radiologyinsights` package

Install the RadiologyInsights REST client library for JavaScript with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @azure-rest/health-insights-radiologyinsights
```

### Create and authenticate a `RadiologyInsightsClient`

|SDK version|Supported API version of service |
|-------------|---------------|
|1.0.0-beta.1 | 2024-01-19-preview|

To use an [Azure Active Directory (AAD) token credential](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/identity/identity/samples/AzureIdentityExamples.md#authenticating-with-a-pre-fetched-access-token),
provide an instance of the desired credential type obtained from the
[@azure/identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/identity/identity#credentials) library.

To authenticate with AAD, you must first `npm` install [`@azure/identity`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity)

After setup, you can choose which type of [credential](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/identity/identity#credentials) from `@azure/identity` to use.
As an example, [DefaultAzureCredential](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/identity/identity#defaultazurecredential)
can be used to authenticate the client.

Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as environment variables:
AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

## Examples

### Create a RadiologyInsights asynchronous client

```typescript
const apiKey = process.env["HEALTH_INSIGHTS_API_KEY"] || "";
const endpoint = process.env["HEALTH_INSIGHTS_ENDPOINT"] || "";
const credential = new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey);
const client = RadiologyInsightsRestClient(endpoint, credential);

## Troubleshooting

### Logging

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling `setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```javascript
const { setLogLevel } = require("@azure/logger");

setLogLevel("info");
```

For more detailed instructions on how to enable logs, you can look at the [@azure/logger package docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/core/logger).
