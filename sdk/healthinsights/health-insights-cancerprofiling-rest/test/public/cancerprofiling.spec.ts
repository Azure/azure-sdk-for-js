       About 3 months prior to admission, she stated she had SOB and was febrile. 
       She did a CXR as an outpatient which showed a finding in the base of the right lung- 
       possibly an infiltrate.
       She was treated with antibiotics with partial response. 
       6 weeks later a repeat CXR was performed- a few solid dense findings in the right lung. 
       Therefore, she was referred for a PET-CT which demonstrated increased uptake in the right 
       breast, lymph nodes on the right a few areas in the lungs and liver. 
       On biopsy from the lesion in the right breast- triple negative adenocarcinoma. Genetic 
       testing has not been done thus far. 
       Genetic counseling- the patient denies a family history of breast, ovary, uterus, 
       and prostate cancer. Her mother has chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
