Healthy, no medications taken on a regular basis.
PMHx is significant for migraines with aura, uses Mirena for contraception.
Smoking history of 10 pack years (has stopped and relapsed several times).
She is in c/o 2 weeks of productive cough and shortness of breath.
She has a fever of 37.8 and general weakness. 
Denies night sweats and rash. She denies symptoms of rhinosinusitis, asthma, and heartburn. 
On PE:
GENERAL: mild pallor, no cyanosis. Regular breathing rate. 
LUNGS: decreased breath sounds on the base of the right lung. Vesicular breathing.
No crackles, rales, and wheezes. Resonant percussion. 
PLAN: 
Will be referred for a chest x-ray. 
======================================
CXR showed mild nonspecific opacities in right lung base. 
PLAN:
Findings are suggestive of a working diagnosis of pneumonia. The patient is referred to a 
follow-up CXR in 2 weeks.`;

Jane Doe 091175-8967
42-year-old healthy female who works as a nurse in the ER of this hospital. 
First menstruation at 11 years old. First delivery- 27 years old. She has 3 children.
Didnâ€™t breastfeed. 
Contraception- Mirena.
Smoking- 10 pack years. 
Mother- Belarusian. Father- Georgian. 
About 3 months prior to admission, she stated she had SOB and was febrile. 
She did a CXR as an outpatient which showed a finding in the base of the right lung- 
possibly an infiltrate.
She was treated with antibiotics with partial response. 
6 weeks later a repeat CXR was performed- a few solid dense findings in the right lung. 
Therefore, she was referred for a PET-CT which demonstrated increased uptake in the right 
breast, lymph nodes on the right a few areas in the lungs and liver. 
On biopsy from the lesion in the right breast- triple negative adenocarcinoma. Genetic 
testing has not been done thus far. 
Genetic counseling- the patient denies a family history of breast, ovary, uterus, 
and prostate cancer. Her mother has chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). 
She is planned to undergo genetic tests because the aggressive course of the disease, 
and her young age. 
Impression:
Stage 4 triple negative breast adenocarcinoma. 
Could benefit from biological therapy. 
Different treatment options were explained- the patient wants to get a second opinion.`;
