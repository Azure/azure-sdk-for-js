# Azure Playwright

Azure Playwright is a fully managed service that uses the cloud to enable you to run Playwright tests with much higher parallelization across different operating system-browser combinations simultaneously. This means faster test runs with broader scenario coverage, which helps speed up delivery of features without sacrificing quality. With Playwright Workspaces, you can release features faster and more confidently.

## Usage

Get started with Azure Playwright with a single command

```sh
npm init @azure/playwright@latest
# Or for Yarn
yarn create @azure/playwright
# Or for pnpm
pnpm create @azure/playwright
```
