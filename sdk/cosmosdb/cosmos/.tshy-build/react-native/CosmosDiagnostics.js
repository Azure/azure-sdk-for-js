/**
 *  * This is a Cosmos Diagnostic type that holds collected diagnostic information during a client operations. ie. Item.read(), Container.create().
 * It has three members -
 * 1. `clientSideRequestStatistics` member contains aggregate diagnostic information, including -
 *   - metadata lookups. Here all the server requests, apart from the final intended resource are considered as metadata calls.
 *    i.e. for item.read(id), if the client makes server call to discover endpoints it would be considered as metadata call.
 *   - retries
 *   - endpoints contacted.
 *   - request, response payload stats.
 *   - gatewayStatistics - Information corresponding to main operation. For example during Item.read(), the client might perform many operations
 *    i.e. metadata lookup etc, but gatewayStatistics represents the diagnostics information for actual read operation.
 *
 * 2. diagnosticNode - Is a tree like structure which captures detailed diagnostic information. By default it is disabled, and is intended to be
 * used only for debugging on non production environments. The kind of details captured in diagnosticNode is controlled by `CosmosDbDiagnosticLevel`.
 * - CosmosDbDiagnosticLevel.info - Is default value. In this level only clientSideRequestStatistics are captured. Is is meant for production environments.
 * - CosmosDbDiagnosticLevel.debug - Captures diagnosticNode and clientConfig. No request and response payloads are captured. Is not meant to be used
 * in production environment.
 * - CosmosDbDiagnosticLevel.debug-unsafe - In addition to data captured in CosmosDbDiagnosticLevel.debug, also captures request and response payloads.
 * Is not meant to be used in production environment.
 * 3. clientConfig - Captures information related to how client was configured during initialization.
