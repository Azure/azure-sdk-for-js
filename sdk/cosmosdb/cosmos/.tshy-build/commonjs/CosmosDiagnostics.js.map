Item.read(), Container.create().\n * It has three members -\n * 1. `clientSideRequestStatistics` member contains aggregate diagnostic information, including -\n *   - metadata lookups. Here all the server requests, apart from the final intended resource are considered as metadata calls.\n *    i.e. for item.read(id), if the client makes server call to discover endpoints it would be considered as metadata call.\n *   - retries\n *   - endpoints contacted.\n *   - request, response payload stats.\n *   - gatewayStatistics - Information corresponding to main operation. For example during Item.read(), the client might perform many operations\n *    i.e. metadata lookup etc, but gatewayStatistics represents the diagnostics information for actual read operation.\n *\n * 2. diagnosticNode - Is a tree like structure which captures detailed diagnostic information. By default it is disabled, and is intended to be\n * used only for debugging on non production environments. The kind of details captured in diagnosticNode is controlled by `CosmosDbDiagnosticLevel`.\n * - CosmosDbDiagnosticLevel.info - Is default value. In this level only clientSideRequestStatistics are captured. Is is meant for production environments.\n * - CosmosDbDiagnosticLevel.debug - Captures diagnosticNode and clientConfig. No request and response payloads are captured. Is not meant to be used\n * in production environment.\n * - CosmosDbDiagnosticLevel.debug-unsafe - In addition to data captured in CosmosDbDiagnosticLevel.debug, also captures request and response payloads.\n * Is not meant to be used in production environment.\n * 3. clientConfig - Captures information related to how client was configured during initialization.\n */\nexport class CosmosDiagnostics {\n  public readonly clientSideRequestStatistics: ClientSideRequestStatistics;\n  public readonly diagnosticNode: DiagnosticNode;\n  public readonly clientConfig?: ClientConfigDiagnostic;\n  /**\n   * @internal\n   */\n  constructor(\n    clientSideRequestStatistics: ClientSideRequestStatistics,\n    diagnosticNode?: DiagnosticNode,\n    clientConfig?: ClientConfigDiagnostic,\n  ) {\n    this.clientSideRequestStatistics = clientSideRequestStatistics;\n    this.diagnosticNode = diagnosticNode;\n    this.clientConfig = clientConfig;\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * This type holds information related to initialization of `CosmosClient`\n */\nexport type ClientConfigDiagnostic = {\n  /**\n   * End point configured during client initialization.\n   */\n  endpoint: string;\n  /**\n   * True if `resourceTokens` was supplied during client initialization.\n   */\n  resourceTokensConfigured: boolean;\n  /**\n   * True if `tokenProvider` was supplied during client initialization.\n   */\n  tokenProviderConfigured: boolean;\n  /**\n   * True if `aadCredentials` was supplied during client initialization.\n   */\n  aadCredentialsConfigured: boolean;\n  /**\n   * True if `connectionPolicy` was supplied during client initialization.\n   */\n  connectionPolicyConfigured: boolean;\n  /**\n   * `consistencyLevel` supplied during client initialization.\n   */\n  consistencyLevel?: keyof typeof ConsistencyLevel;\n  /**\n   * `defaultHeaders` supplied during client initialization.\n   */\n  defaultHeaders?: { [key: string]: any };\n  /**\n   * True if `connectionPolicy` were supplied during client initialization.\n   */\n  agentConfigured: boolean;\n  /**\n   * `userAgentSuffix` supplied during client initialization.\n   */\n  userAgentSuffix: string;\n  /**\n   * `diagnosticLevel` supplied during client initialization.\n   */\n  diagnosticLevel?: CosmosDbDiagnosticLevel;\n  /**\n   * True if `plugins` were supplied during client initialization.\n   */\n  pluginsConfigured: boolean;\n  /**\n   * SDK version\n   */\n  sDKVersion: string;\n};\n\n/**\n * This type contains diagnostic information regarding all metadata request to server during an CosmosDB client operation.\n */\nexport type MetadataLookUpDiagnostics = {\n  metadataLookups: MetadataLookUpDiagnostic[];\n};\n\n/**\n * This type captures diagnostic information regarding retries attempt during an CosmosDB client operation.\n */\nexport type RetryDiagnostics = {\n  failedAttempts: FailedRequestAttemptDiagnostic[];\n};\n\nexport type GatewayStatistics = {\n  /**\n   * This is the activityId for request, made to server for fetching the requested resource.
