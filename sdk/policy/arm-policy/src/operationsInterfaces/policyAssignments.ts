   * 'Microsoft.Web/sites', {resourceName} == 'MyWebApp').
   * @param resourceGroupName The name of the resource group containing the resource.
   * @param resourceProviderNamespace The namespace of the resource provider. For example, the namespace
   *                                  of a virtual machine is Microsoft.Compute (from Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines)
   * @param parentResourcePath The parent resource path. Use empty string if there is none.
   * @param resourceType The resource type name. For example the type name of a web app is 'sites' (from
   *                     Microsoft.Web/sites).
   * @param resourceName The name of the resource.
