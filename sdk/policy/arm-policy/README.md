# Azure Policy client library for JavaScript

This package contains an isomorphic SDK (runs both in Node.js and in browsers) for Azure Policy client.

To manage and control access to your resources, you can define customized policies and assign them at a scope.

## Getting started

### Currently supported environments

- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/about/releases/)
- Latest versions of Safari, Chrome, Edge and Firefox.

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].

### Install the `@azure/arm-policy` package

Install the Azure Policy client library for JavaScript with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @azure/arm-policy
```

### Create and authenticate a `PolicyClient`

To create a client object to access the Azure Policy API, you will need the `endpoint` of your Azure Policy resource and a `credential`. The Azure Policy client can use Azure Active Directory credentials to authenticate.
You can find the endpoint for your Azure Policy resource in the [Azure Portal][azure_portal].

#### Using an Azure Active Directory Credential

You can authenticate with Azure Active Directory using the [Azure Identity library][azure_identity]. To use the [DefaultAzureCredential][defaultazurecredential] provider shown below, or other credential providers provided with the Azure SDK, please install the `@azure/identity` package:

```bash
npm install @azure/identity
```

You will also need to register a new AAD application and grant access to Azure Policy by assigning the suitable role to your service principal (note: roles such as `"Owner"` will not grant the necessary permissions).
Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as environment variables: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

```javascript
const { PolicyClient } = require("@azure/arm-policy");
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const client = new PolicyClient("<endpoint>", new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

## Key concepts

### PolicyClient

`PolicyClient` is the primary interface for developers using the Azure Policy client library. Explore the methods on this client object to understand the different features of the Azure Policy service that you can access.

## Troubleshooting

### Logging

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling `setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```javascript
import { setLogLevel } from "@azure/logger";
setLogLevel("info");
```

For more detailed instructions on how to enable logs, you can look at the [@azure/logger package docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/core/logger).
