 *
 * $top indicates the total number of records the user wants to be returned across all pages.
 * $skip indicates the number of records to skip from the list of document status held by the server based on the sorting method specified.  By default, we sort by descending start time.
 * $maxpagesize is the maximum items returned in a page.  If more items are requested via $top (or $top is not specified and there are more items to be returned), \@nextLink will contain the link to the next page.
 *
 * $orderBy query parameter can be used to sort the returned list (ex "$orderBy=createdDateTimeUtc asc" or "$orderBy=createdDateTimeUtc desc").
 * The default sorting is descending by createdDateTimeUtc.
 * Some query parameters can be used to filter the returned list (ex: "status=Succeeded,Cancelled") will only return succeeded and cancelled documents.
 * createdDateTimeUtcStart and createdDateTimeUtcEnd can be used combined or separately to specify a range of datetime to filter the returned list by.
 * The supported filtering query parameters are (status, ids, createdDateTimeUtcStart, createdDateTimeUtcEnd).
 *
 * When both $top and $skip are included, the server should first apply $skip and then $top on the collection.
 * Note: If the server can't honor $top and/or $skip, the server must return an error to the client informing about it instead of just ignoring the query options.
 * This reduces the risk of the client making assumptions about the data returned.
