# Azure TextAnalytics client library for JavaScript

[Azure TextAnalytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/) is a cloud-based service that provides advanced natural language processing over raw text, and includes four main functions: sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, language detection, and entity recognition.

Use the client library to:

- Detect what language input text is written in.
- Determine what customers think of your brand or topic by analyzing raw text for clues about positive or negative sentiment.
- Automatically extract key phrases to quickly identify the main points.
- Identify and categorize entities in your text as people, places, organizations, date/time, quantities, percentages, currencies, and more.

## Getting started

### Currently supported environments

- Node.js version 8.x.x or higher

**Prerequisites**: You must have an [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com) and an [Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) resource to use this package.

### 1. Install the `@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics` package

```bash
npm install @azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics
```

### 2. Create and authenticate a `TextAnalyticsClient`

TextAnalytics uses both AAD and service keys for authentication.

Creating a client with a service key:

```js
const client = new TextAnalyticsClient(
  "<endpoint>",
  new CognitiveServicesCredentials("<service key>")
);
```

## Key concepts

Content still being written.

## Examples

### Detect the language of an input string

```js
const [result] = await client.detectLanguage(["hello world"]);
console.log(`Primary language detected as ${result.primaryLanguage.name}`);
```

## Troubleshooting
