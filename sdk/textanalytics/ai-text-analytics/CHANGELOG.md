# Release History

## 5.0.1 (2020-08-18)

- Handles REST exceptions with code InvalidDocumentBatch in a way that maintains backward compatability.

## 5.0.0 (2020-07-27)

- Updated the package version to be 5.0.0 instead of 1.0.0 in order to reduce confusion with older versions of the Azure Text Analytics SDKs.

## 1.0.0 (2020-06-09)

- This release marks the general availability of the `@azure/ai-text-analytics` package.

## 1.0.0-preview.5 (2020-05-26)
- [Breaking] Renamed all result array types that extend JavaScript's base `Array` class to end with the word `Array` instead of `Collection` (e.g. `AnalyzeSentimentResultCollection` is now `AnalyzeSentimentResultArray`)
- [Breaking] Renamed `score` to `confidenceScore` in the `Match`, `Entity`, and `DetectedLanguage` types.
- [Breaking] Removed the `graphemeOffset` and `graphemeLength` properties of the `Match`, `Entity`, and `SentenceSentiment` types.
- [Breaking] Renamed the `graphemeCount` property of `TextDocumentStatistics` back to `characterCount`
- Added a `text` property to `SentenceSentiment` that contains the sentence text
- [Breaking] Removed the `warnings` property of `SentenceSentiment`.
- Added `warnings` property to every document response object containing a list of `TextAnalyticsWarning` objects relevant to the corresponding document.
- Migrated to using the Text Analytics v3.0 (General Availability) service endpoint.


## 1.0.0-preview.4 (2020-04-07)
- Renamed the first parameter of all operation methods from `inputs` to `documents`
- [Breaking] Removed PII entity detection methods from `TextAnalyticsClient` as well as all associated samples and documentation
- [Breaking] Replaced `TextAnalyticsApiKeyCredential` with `AzureKeyCredential` (re-exported through this package from `@azure/core-auth`).
- `TextAnalyticsClient` methods now throw an error when the `documents` parameter is not an array or empty before sending a request to the Text Analytics service.

## 1.0.0-preview.3 (2020-03-10)
- [Breaking] Renamed `id` to `dataSourceEntityId` in the `LinkedEntity` type.
- Added special handling for the string `"none"` as the `countryHint` parameter of the `TextAnalyticsClient.detectLanguage`. `"none"` is now treated the same as the empty string, and indicates that the default language detection model should be used.
- [Breaking] Renamed `offset` to `graphemeOffset` and `length` to `graphemeLength` in fields of response objects as appropriate in order to make it clear that the offsets and lengths are in units of Unicode graphemes.
- [Breaking] Renamed `sentimentScores` on both `DocumentSentiment` and `SentenceSentiment` to `confidenceScores`, and renamed the type `SentimentScorePerLabel` to `SentimentConfidenceScores`.
- [Breaking] Renamed `characterCount` to `graphemeCount` in the `DocumentStatistics` interface, to align with the change to using `grapheme` in the lengths/offsets of response objects.

## 1.0.0-preview.2 (2020-02-11)

- Added support for rotating API keys via the `TextAnalyticsApiKeyCredential.updateKey` method.
- Added a discriminant type for `TextAnalyticsResult.error` to allow for easy differentiation between success and error types using `if (result.error) { ... }` in both TypeScript and JavaScript.
- [Breaking] Removed the `Entity` type and added new return types `CategorizedEntity` and `PiiEntity` for the `recognizeEntities` and `recognizePiiEntities` methods respectively. These types are equivalent to the previous `Entity` type.
- [Breaking] Removed the `detectedLanguages` property from `DetectLanguageResult`, as the service currently only returns one language.
- [Breaking] Renamed the `detectLanguages` method to `detectLanguage`, as the `detectedLanguages` property was removed from the `DetectLanguageResult` return type.
- [Breaking] Renamed `documentScores` and `sentenceScores` on the `DocumentSentiment` and `SentenceSentiment` types both to `sentimentScores`.
- [Breaking] Renamed `type` and `subtype` to `category` and `subcategory` respectively in the `CategorizedEntity` and `PiiEntity` types.
- [Breaking] Renamed `DocumentSentimentValue` and `SentenceSentimentValue` to `DocumentSentimentLabel` and `SentenceSentimentLabel` respectively.
- [Breaking] Renamed `SentimentConfidenceScorePerLabel` to `SentimentScorePerLabel`.
- [Breaking] Refactored `TextAnalyticsError` to flatten the error hierarchy and remove `innerError`. The new error model has properties for `code`, `message`, and an optional `target` only. The `code` property of `TextAnalyticsError` can now contain all of the codes from the previous `InnerErrorCodeValue` as well as those from the top-level `ErrorCodeValue`.

## 1.0.0-preview.1 (2020-01-09)

  idiomatic to the JavaScript ecosystem. The reasons for most of the changes in this update can be found in the
