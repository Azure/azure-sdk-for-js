# Release History

## 1.0.0-preview.1 (2020-01-09)

- This release is a preview of our efforts to create a client library that is user friendly and
  idiomatic to the JavaScript ecosystem. The reasons for most of the changes in this update can be found in the
  [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for TypeScript](https://azuresdkspecs.z5.web.core.windows.net/TypeScriptSpec.html).
- Differences from previous public package:
  - Package name changed from `@azure/cognitiveservices-textanalytics` to `@azure/ai-text-analytics`.
  - Package targets version `3.0` of the service API.
  - Supports authentication via `@azure/identity`.
