# Release History

## 12.2.0-beta.1 (2024-09-25)

### Breaking Changes

- Added trivial API changes to align with the latest stable release [#31133](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/31133)

### Features Added

- `SplitSkill` can now be configured to use Azure OpenAI through `SplitSkill.AzureOpenAITokenizerParameters`
