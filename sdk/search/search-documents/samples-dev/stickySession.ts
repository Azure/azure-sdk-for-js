 * If you're querying a replicated index, Azure AI Search may target any replica with your queries.
 * As these replicas may not be in a consistent state, the service may appear to have inconsistent
 * states between distinct queries. To avoid this, you can use a sticky session. A sticky session
 * is used to indicate to the Azure AI Search service that you'd like all requests with the same
 * `sessionId` to be directed to the same replica. The service will then make a best effort to do
 * so.
