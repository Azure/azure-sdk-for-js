/**
 * **Geocoding Batch API**
 *
 *
 * **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).
 *
 *
 *
 * The Geocoding Batch API sends batches of queries to [Geocoding API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-geocoding) using just a single API call. The API allows caller to batch up to **100** queries.
 *
 * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
 * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.
 * ```
 * POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/geocode:batch?api-version=2023-06-01
 * ```
 * ### POST Body for Batch Request
 * To send the _geocoding_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a sample request body containing 2 _geocoding_ queries:
 *
 *
 * ```
 * {
 *   "batchItems": [
 *     {
 *       "addressLine": "One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052",
 *       "top": 2
 *     },
 *     {
 *       "addressLine": "Pike Pl",
 *       "adminDistrict": "WA",
 *       "locality": "Seattle",
 *       "top": 3
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A _geocoding_ batchItem object can accept any of the supported _geocoding_ [URI parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-geocoding#uri-parameters).
 *
 *
 * The batch should contain at least **1** query.
 *
 *
 * ### Batch Response Model
 * The batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request and `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item is of one of the following types:
 *
 *   - [`GeocodingResponse`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-geocoding#geocodingresponse) - If the query completed successfully.
 *
 *   - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
