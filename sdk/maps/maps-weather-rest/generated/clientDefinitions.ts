When submitting the waypoints, it is recommended to stay within, or close to, the distance that can be traveled within 120-mins or shortly after. Data is updated every five minutes.
   *
   *  The service supplements Azure Maps [Route Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route) that allows you to first request a route between an origin and a destination and use that as an input for Weather Along Route endpoint.
   *
   *  In addition, the service supports scenarios to generate weather notifications for waypoints that experience an increase in intensity of a weather hazard. For example, if the vehicle is expected to begin experiencing heavy rain as it reaches a waypoint, a weather notification for heavy rain will be generated for that waypoint allowing the end product to display a heavy rain notification before the driver reaches that waypoint.
   *  The trigger for when to display the notification for a waypoint could be based, for example, on a [geofence](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/tutorial-iot-hub-maps), or selectable distance to the waypoint.
