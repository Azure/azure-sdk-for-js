## Customization for Track 2 Generator

### RouteDirectionParameters Transform

```yaml
directive:
  - from: swagger-document
    where: $.definitions.RouteDirectionParameters.properties.supportingPoints
    transform: >
      $ = {
        "description": "A GeoJSON Geometry collection representing sequence of coordinates used as input for route reconstruction and for calculating zero or more alternative routes to this reference route.\n  - The provided sequence of supporting points is used as input for route reconstruction.\n  - The alternative routes are calculated between the origin and destination points specified in the base path parameter locations.\n  - If both _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ are set to zero, then these origin and destination points are\n  expected to be at (or very near) the beginning and end of the reference route, respectively.\n  - Intermediate locations (_waypoints_) are not supported when using <_supportingPoints_>.\n  - The reference route may contain traffic incidents of type _ROAD_CLOSURE_, which are\n  ignored for the calculation of the reference route's travel time and traffic delay.",
        "type": "object"
      };
    reason: Autorest TS codegen does not deserialize array of base class objects as an operation parameter properly -> https://github.com/Azure/autorest.typescript/issues/1040
