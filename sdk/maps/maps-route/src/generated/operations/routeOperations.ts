   *
   * The Matrix Routing service allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries for a set of routes
   * defined by origin and destination locations by using an asynchronous (async) or synchronous (sync)
   * POST request. For every given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to
   * every given destination. The set of origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the
   * column and row headers of a table and each cell in the table contains the costs of routing from the
   * origin to the destination for that cell. As an example, let's say a food delivery company has 20
   * drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from the restaurant. To
   * solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.
   *
   *
   * For each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to
   * determine which detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.
   *
   *
   * The maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the
   * number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations).
   *
   *
   *
   * ### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request
   * If your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or
   * equal to 100, you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API
   * is **100** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in
   * mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).
   *
   * ```
   * POST
   * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}
   * ```
   *
   * ### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request
   * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing
   * requests. When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202
   * response code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be
   * checked periodically until the response data or error information is available. If `waitForResults`
   * parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200 response if the request is finished
   * under 120 seconds.
   *
   *
   * The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number
   * of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10,
   * 10x10, 28x25. 10x70 (it does not need to be square).
   *
   *
   * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if
   * used after the expiration period.
   *
   *
   *
   *
   * ```
   * POST
   * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}
   * ```
   *
   * Here's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:
   * 1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps
   *
   * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
   *
   *     > HTTP `202 Accepted` -  Route Matrix request has been accepted.
   *
   *     > HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a
   * 400 Bad Request or any other Error status code.
   *
   *
   * 3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response
   * contains the URL to download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:
   *
   *   ```
   *     GET
   * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
   *   ```
   *
   *
   * 4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results
   *
   * ### Download Sync Results
   * When you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for
   * successful request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be
   * no possibility to retrieve the results later.
   *
   * ### Download Async Results
   * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async
   * pipeline. You will be given a URL to check the progress of your  async request in the location
   * header of the response. This status URI looks like the following:
   * ```
   *   GET
   * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
   * ```
   *
   * The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is
   * issued.
   *
   *   > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again
   * in some time.
   *
   *   > HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the
   * results.
   * @param format Desired format of the response. Only `json` format is supported.
   * @param routeMatrixQuery The matrix of origin and destination coordinates to compute the route
   *                         distance, travel time and other summary for each cell of the matrix based on the input parameters.
   *                         The minimum and the maximum cell count supported are 1 and **700** for async and **100** for sync
   *                         respectively. For example, it can be 35 origins and 20 destinations or 25 origins and 25
   *                         destinations for async API.
   * @param options The options parameters.

   * no possibility to retrieve the results later.
   *
   * ### Download Async Results
   * When a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async
   * pipeline. You will be given a URL to check the progress of your  async request in the location
   * header of the response. This status URI looks like the following:
   * ```
   *   GET
   * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}
   * ```
   *
   * The URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is
   * issued.
   *
   *   > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again
   * in some time.
   *
   *   > HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the
   * results.
   * @param format Desired format of the response. Only `json` format is supported.
   * @param routeMatrixQuery The matrix of origin and destination coordinates to compute the route
   *                         distance, travel time and other summary for each cell of the matrix based on the input parameters.
   *                         The minimum and the maximum cell count supported are 1 and **700** for async and **100** for sync
   *                         respectively. For example, it can be 35 origins and 20 destinations or 25 origins and 25
   *                         destinations for async API.
   * @param options The options parameters.

  /**
   * **Route Directions Batch API**
   *
   *
   * **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).
   *
   *
   *
   * The Route Directions Batch API sends batches of queries to [Route Directions
   * API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections) using just a single API
   * call. You can call Route Directions Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously
   * (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100**
   * queries.
   * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
   * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex route requests
   * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
   * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
   * - The number of batch items is limited to **700** for this API.
   *
   * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code
   * along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked
   * periodically until the response data or error information is available.
   * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if
   * used after the expiration period.
   *
   * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's a typical sequence of
   * operations:
   * 1. Client sends a Route Directions Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps
   * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
   *
   *     > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
   *
   *     > HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400
   * Bad Request` or any other `Error` status code.
   *
   * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains
   * the URL to download the results of the batch request.
   *     This status URI looks like following:
   *
   * ``` GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0 ```
   * Note:- Please remember to add AUTH information (subscription-key/azure_auth - See
   * [Security](#security)) to the _status URI_ before running it. <br>
   * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch
   * results.
   *
   * ### POST Body for Batch Request
   * To send the _route directions_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will
   * contain the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to
   * `application/json`. Here's a sample request body containing 3 _route directions_ queries:
   *
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *     "batchItems": [
   *         { "query":
   * "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&travelMode=bicycle&routeType=eco&traffic=false"
   * },
   *         { "query":
   * "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&travelMode=pedestrian&routeType=shortest" },
   *         { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" }
   *     ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * A _route directions_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
   * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _route directions_ [URI
   * parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters). The
   * string values in the _route directions_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be
   * escaped with \\ ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
   *
   *
   * The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and
   * the batch should contain at least **1** query.
   *
   *
   * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
   * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint.
   * This _download URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request
   * and looks like the following:
   *
   * ```
   * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}
   * ```
   * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
   * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
   * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
   *
   *     > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try
   * again in some time.
   *
   *     > HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch
   * results.
   *
   *
   *
   * ### Batch Response Model
   * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an
   * async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch
   * response. This batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that
   * were part of the original batch request and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed
   * successfully. The batch response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for
   * each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact
   * same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in `batchItems` contains
   * `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the following
   * types:
   *
   *   -
   * [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections)
   * - If the query completed successfully.
   *
   *   - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
   *
   *
   * Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
   *
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *     "summary": {
   *         "successfulRequests": 1,
   *         "totalRequests": 2
   *     },
   *     "batchItems": [
   *         {
   *             "statusCode": 200,
   *             "response": {

  /**
   * **Route Directions Batch API**
   *
   *
   * **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).
   *
   *
   *
   * The Route Directions Batch API sends batches of queries to [Route Directions
   * API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections) using just a single API
   * call. You can call Route Directions Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously
   * (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100**
   * queries.
   * ### Submit Asynchronous Batch Request
   * The Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex route requests
   * - It allows the retrieval of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible).
   * - The asynchronous API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.
   * - The number of batch items is limited to **700** for this API.
   *
   * When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code
   * along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked
   * periodically until the response data or error information is available.
   * The asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if
   * used after the expiration period.
   *
   * Please note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request. Here's a typical sequence of
   * operations:
   * 1. Client sends a Route Directions Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps
   * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
   *
   *     > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.
   *
   *     > HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This could either be a `400
   * Bad Request` or any other `Error` status code.
   *
   * 3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in the response contains
   * the URL to download the results of the batch request.
   *     This status URI looks like following:
   *
   * ``` GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0 ```
   * Note:- Please remember to add AUTH information (subscription-key/azure_auth - See
   * [Security](#security)) to the _status URI_ before running it. <br>
   * 4. Client issues a `GET` request on the _download URL_ obtained in Step 3 to download the batch
   * results.
   *
   * ### POST Body for Batch Request
   * To send the _route directions_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will
   * contain the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to
   * `application/json`. Here's a sample request body containing 3 _route directions_ queries:
   *
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *     "batchItems": [
   *         { "query":
   * "?query=47.620659,-122.348934:47.610101,-122.342015&travelMode=bicycle&routeType=eco&traffic=false"
   * },
   *         { "query":
   * "?query=40.759856,-73.985108:40.771136,-73.973506&travelMode=pedestrian&routeType=shortest" },
   *         { "query": "?query=48.923159,-122.557362:32.621279,-116.840362" }
   *     ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * A _route directions_ query in a batch is just a partial URL _without_ the protocol, base URL, path,
   * api-version and subscription-key. It can accept any of the supported _route directions_ [URI
   * parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters). The
   * string values in the _route directions_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. " character should be
   * escaped with \\ ) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.
   *
   *
   * The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100** queries, and
   * the batch should contain at least **1** query.
   *
   *
   * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
   * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint.
   * This _download URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request
   * and looks like the following:
   *
   * ```
   * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}
   * ```
   * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
   * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
   * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
   *
   *     > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try
   * again in some time.
   *
   *     > HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch
   * results.
   *
   *
   *
   * ### Batch Response Model
   * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an
   * async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch
   * response. This batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that
   * were part of the original batch request and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed
   * successfully. The batch response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for
   * each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact
   * same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in `batchItems` contains
   * `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the following
   * types:
   *
   *   -
   * [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections)
   * - If the query completed successfully.
   *
   *   - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
   *
   *
   * Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
   *
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *     "summary": {
   *         "successfulRequests": 1,
   *         "totalRequests": 2
   *     },
   *     "batchItems": [
   *         {
   *             "statusCode": 200,
   *             "response": {
   *                 "routes": [
   *                     {
   *                         "summary": {

   *
   * ### Download Asynchronous Batch Results
   * To download the async batch results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download endpoint.
   * This _download URL_ can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful `POST` batch request
   * and looks like the following:
   *
   * ```
   * https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}
   * ```
   * Here's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:
   * 1. Client sends a `GET` request using the _download URL_.
   * 2. The server will respond with one of the following:
   *
   *     > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try
   * again in some time.
   *
   *     > HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The response body contains all the batch
   * results.
   *
   *
   *
   * ### Batch Response Model
   * The returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading the results of an
   * async batch request, if the batch has finished processing, the response body contains the batch
   * response. This batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that
   * were part of the original batch request and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed
   * successfully. The batch response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for
   * each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact
   * same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item in `batchItems` contains
   * `statusCode` and `response` fields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the following
   * types:
   *
   *   -
   * [`RouteDirections`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections)
   * - If the query completed successfully.
   *
   *   - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.
   *
   *
   * Here's a sample Batch Response with 1 _successful_ and 1 _failed_ result:
   *
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *     "summary": {
   *         "successfulRequests": 1,
   *         "totalRequests": 2
   *     },
   *     "batchItems": [

  /**
   * **Route Directions Batch API**
   *
   *
   * **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).
   *
   *
   *
   * The Route Directions Batch API sends batches of queries to [Route Directions
   * API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections) using just a single API
   * call. You can call Route Directions Batch API to run either asynchronously (async) or synchronously
   * (sync). The async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and sync API up to **100**
   * queries.
   * ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request
   * The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a
   * request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility
   * to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if
   * the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited to **100** for this
   * API.
   * ```
   * POST
