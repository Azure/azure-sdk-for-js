For the configuration property, please refer to [Index of AutoRestFlag](https://github.com/Azure/autorest/blob/main/docs/generate/flags.md).

# This flag generated files including all the config files, LICENSE, sample.env, and package.json.
# We switch this to false after the first generation because we have some manual changes in these files and don't want them get overwrite.

# Although maps service supports key-credentials and AAD, maps service requires header "ms-x-client-id", which is different from the standard AAD, so we don't generate AAD code and implement ourselves.

## Customization for Track 2 Generator

To understand more about how Directives works, please refer to: https://github.com/Azure/autorest/blob/main/docs/generate/directives.md

### Change the schema of SharedKey

Replace `query` with `header` in the field `in` since [modelerfour](https://github.com/Azure/autorest/tree/main/packages/extensions/modelerfour) considers this is invalid.

```yaml
directive:
  - from: swagger-document
    where: $.securityDefinitions
    transform: |
      $["SharedKey"]["in"] = "header";
```
