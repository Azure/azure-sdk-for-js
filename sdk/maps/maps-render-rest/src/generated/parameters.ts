  /**
   * Pushpin style and instances. Use this parameter to optionally add pushpins to the image.
   * The pushpin style describes the appearance of the pushpins, and the instances specify
   * the coordinates of the pushpins (in double) and optional labels for each pin. (Be sure to properly URL-encode values of this
   * parameter since it will contain reserved characters such as pipes and punctuation.)
   *
   * The Azure Maps account S0 SKU only supports a single instance of the pins parameter and the number of locations is limited to 5 per pin. Other SKUs
   * allow up to 25 instances of the pins parameter to specify multiple pin styles, and the number of locations is limited to 50 per pin.
   *
   * To render a pushpin at latitude 45°N and longitude 122°W using the default built-in pushpin style, add the
   * querystring parameter
   *
   * `pins=default||-122 45`
   *
   * Note that the longitude comes before the latitude.
   * After URL encoding this will look like
   *
   * `pins=default%7C%7C-122+45`
   *
   * All of the examples here show the pins
   * parameter without URL encoding, for clarity.
   *
   * To render a pin at multiple locations, separate each location with a pipe character. For example, use
   *
   * `pins=default||-122 45|-119.5 43.2|-121.67 47.12`
   *
   * The S0 Azure Maps account SKU only allows five pushpins. Other account SKUs do not have this limitation.
   *
   * ### Style Modifiers
   *
   * You can modify the appearance of the pins by adding style modifiers. These are added after the style but before
   * the locations and labels. Style modifiers each have a two-letter name. These abbreviated names are used to help
   * reduce the length of the URL.
   *
   * To change the color of the pushpin, use the 'co' style modifier and specify the color using the HTML/CSS RGB color
   * format which is a six-digit hexadecimal number (the three-digit form is not supported). For example, to use
   * a deep pink color which you would specify as #FF1493 in CSS, use
   *
   * `pins=default|coFF1493||-122 45`
   *
   * ### Pushpin Labels
   *
   * To add a label to the pins, put the label in single quotes just before the coordinates. Avoid using special character such as `|` or `||` in label. For example, to label
   * three pins with the values '1', '2', and '3', use
   *
   * `pins=default||'1'-122 45|'2'-119.5 43.2|'3'-121.67 47.12`
   *
   * There is a built-in pushpin style called 'none' that does not display a pushpin image. You can use this if
   * you want to display labels without any pin image. For example,
   *
   * `pins=none||'A'-122 45|'B'-119.5 43.2`
   *
   * To change the color of the pushpin labels, use the 'lc' label color style modifier. For example, to use pink
   * pushpins with black labels, use
   *
   * `pins=default|coFF1493|lc000000||-122 45`
   *
   * To change the size of the labels, use the 'ls' label size style modifier. The label size represents the approximate
   * height of the label text in pixels. For example, to increase the label size to 12, use
   *
   * `pins=default|ls12||'A'-122 45|'B'-119 43`
   *
   * The labels are centered at the pushpin 'label anchor.' The anchor location is predefined for built-in pushpins and
   * is at the top center of custom pushpins (see below). To override the label anchor, using the 'la' style modifier
   * and provide X and Y pixel coordinates for the anchor. These coordinates are relative to the top left corner of the
   * pushpin image. Positive X values move the anchor to the right, and positive Y values move the anchor down. For example,
   * to position the label anchor 10 pixels right and 4 pixels above the top left corner of the pushpin image,
   * use
   *
   * `pins=default|la10 -4||'A'-122 45|'B'-119 43`
   *
   * ### Custom Pushpins
   *
   * To use a custom pushpin image, use the word 'custom' as the pin style name, and then specify a URL after the
   * location and label information. The maximum allowed size for a customized label image is 65,536 pixels. Use two pipe characters to indicate that you're done specifying locations and are
   * starting the URL. For example,
   *
   * `pins=custom||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`
   *
   * After URL encoding, this would look like
   *
   * `pins=custom%7C%7C-122+45%7C%7Chttp%3A%2F%2Fcontoso.com%2Fpushpins%2Fred.png`
   *
   * By default, custom pushpin images are drawn centered at the pin coordinates. This usually isn't ideal as it obscures
   * the location that you're trying to highlight. To override the anchor location of the pin image, use the 'an'
   * style modifier. This uses the same format as the 'la' label anchor style modifier. For example, if your custom
   * pin image has the tip of the pin at the top left corner of the image, you can set the anchor to that spot by
   * using
   *
   * `pins=custom|an0 0||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`
   *
   * Note: If you use the 'co' color modifier with a custom pushpin image, the specified color will replace the RGB
   * channels of the pixels in the image but will leave the alpha (opacity) channel unchanged. This would usually
   * only be done with a solid-color custom image.
   *
   * ### Scale, Rotation, and Opacity
   *
   * You can make pushpins and their labels larger or smaller by using the 'sc' scale style modifier. This is a
   * value greater than zero. A value of 1 is the standard scale. Values larger than 1 will make the pins larger, and
   * values smaller than 1 will make them smaller. For example, to draw the pushpins 50% larger than normal, use
   *
   * `pins=default|sc1.5||-122 45`
   *
   * You can rotate pushpins and their labels by using the 'ro' rotation style modifier. This is a number of degrees
   * of clockwise rotation. Use a negative number to rotate counter-clockwise. For example, to rotate the pushpins
   * 90 degrees clockwise and double their size, use
   *
   * `pins=default|ro90|sc2||-122 45`
   *
   * You can make pushpins and their labels partially transparent by specifying the 'al' alpha style modifier.
   * This is a number between 0 and 1 indicating the opacity of the pushpins. Zero makes them completely transparent
   * (and not visible) and 1 makes them completely opaque (which is the default). For example, to make pushpins
   * and their labels only 67% opaque, use
   *
   * `pins=default|al.67||-122 45`
   *
   * ### Style Modifier Summary
   *
   * Modifier  | Description    | Type    | Range
   * :--------:|---------------|--------|----------
   * al        | Alpha (opacity) |  float | 0 to 1
   * an        | Pin anchor    | <int32, int32>  | *

   * sc        | Scale         | float  | Greater than 0
   *
   * * X and Y coordinates can be anywhere within pin image or a margin around it.
   * The margin size is the minimum of the pin width and height.
   */
  pins?: string;
  /**
   * Path style and locations (in double). Use this parameter to optionally add lines, polygons or circles to the image.
   * The path style describes the appearance of the line and fill. (Be sure to properly URL-encode values of this
   * parameter since it will contain reserved characters such as pipes and punctuation.)
   *
   * Path parameter is supported in Azure Maps account SKU starting with S1. Multiple instances of the path parameter
   * allow to specify multiple geometries with their styles. Number of parameters per request is limited to 10 and
   * number of locations is limited to 100 per path.
   *
   * To render a circle with radius 100 meters and center point at latitude 45°N and longitude 122°W using the default style, add the
   * querystring parameter
   *
   * `path=ra100||-122 45`
   *
   * Note that the longitude comes before the latitude.
   * After URL encoding this will look like
   *
   * `path=ra100%7C%7C-122+45`
   *
   * All of the examples here show the path parameter without URL encoding, for clarity.
   *

   *
   * `path=||-122 45|-119.5 43.2|-121.67 47.12`
   *
   * A polygon is specified with a closed path, where the first and last points are equal. For example, use
   *
   * `path=||-122 45|-119.5 43.2|-121.67 47.12|-122 45`
   *
   * Longitude value for locations of lines and polygons can be in the range from -360 to 360 to allow for rendering of geometries crossing the anti-meridian.
   *
   * ### Style Modifiers
   *
   * You can modify the appearance of the path by adding style modifiers. These are added before the locations.
   * Style modifiers each have a two-letter name. These abbreviated names are used to help reduce the length
   * of the URL.
   *
   * To change the color of the outline, use the 'lc' style modifier and specify the color using the HTML/CSS RGB color

   *
   * `path=lcFF1493||-122 45|-119.5 43.2`
   *
   * Multiple style modifiers may be combined to create a more complex visual style.
   *
   * `lc0000FF|lw3|la0.60|fa0.50||-122.2 47.6|-122.2 47.7|-122.3 47.7|-122.3 47.6|-122.2 47.6`
