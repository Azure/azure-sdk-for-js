# Testing

To test this project, make sure to build it by following our [building instructions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#building), then follow the [testing instructions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing).

The DigitalTwins client does not have any recorded tests and so, all the tests require an Azure DigitalTwins account to be set up beforehand. You can use existing Azure resources for the live tests.
