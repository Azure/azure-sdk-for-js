# Azure Storage File Share client library for JavaScript

Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Azure file shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments of Windows, Linux, and macOS. Additionally, Azure file shares can be cached on Windows Servers with Azure File Sync for fast access near where the data is being used.

This project provides a client library in JavaScript that makes it easy to consume Microsoft Azure File Storage service.

Use the client libraries in this package to:

- Get/Set File Service Properties
- Create/List/Delete File Shares
- Create/List/Delete File Directories
- Create/Read/List/Update/Delete Files

> Note: This package was previously published under the name `@azure/storage-file`.
> It has been renamed to `@azure/storage-file-share` to better align with the upcoming new package
> for Azure Storage Files DataLake and provide a consistent set of APIs for working with files on Azure.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites**: You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and a [Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-how-to-use-files-portal) to use this package. If you are using this package in a Node.js application, then Node.js version 8.0.0 or higher is required.

### Install the package

The preferred way to install the Azure File Storage client library for JavaScript is to use the npm package manager. Type the following into a terminal window:

```bash
npm install @azure/storage-file-share
```

### Authenticate the client

Azure Storage supports several ways to authenticate. In order to interact with the Azure Storage File Share service you'll need to create an instance of a Storage client - `ShareServiceClient`, `ShareClient`, or `ShareDirectoryClient` for example. See [samples for creating the `ShareServiceClient`](#create-the-share-service-client) to learn more about authentication.

- [Shared Key](#with-storagesharedkeycredential)
- [Shared access signatures](#with-sas-token)

### Compatibility

This library is compatible with Node.js and browsers, and validated against LTS Node.js versions (>=8.16.0) and latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

#### Compatible with IE11

You need polyfills to make this library work with IE11. The easiest way is to use [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill), or [polyfill service](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/).

You can also load separate polyfills for missed ES feature(s).
This library depends on following ES features which need external polyfills loaded.

- `Promise`
- `String.prototype.startsWith`
- `String.prototype.endsWith`
- `String.prototype.repeat`
- `String.prototype.includes`
- `Array.prototype.includes`
- `Object.assign`
- `Object.keys` (Overrides the IE11's `Object.keys` with a polyfill to enable the [ES6 behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys#Notes))
- `Symbol`
- `Symbol.iterator`

#### Differences between Node.js and browsers

There are differences between Node.js and browsers runtime. When getting started with this library, pay attention to APIs or classes marked with _"ONLY AVAILABLE IN NODE.JS RUNTIME"_ or _"ONLY AVAILABLE IN BROWSERS"_.

- If a file holds compressed data in `gzip` or `deflate` format and its content encoding is set accordingly, downloading behavior is different between Node.js and browsers. In Node.js storage clients will download the file in its compressed format, while in browsers the data will be downloaded in de-compressed format.

##### Following features, interfaces, classes or functions are only available in Node.js

- Shared Key Authorization based on account name and account key
  - `StorageSharedKeyCredential`
- Shared Access Signature(SAS) generation
  - `generateAccountSASQueryParameters()`
  - `generateFileSASQueryParameters()`
- Parallel uploading and downloading. Note that `ShareFileClient.uploadData()` is available in both Node.js and browsers.
  - `ShareFileClient.uploadFile()`
  - `ShareFileClient.uploadStream()`
  - `ShareFileClient.downloadToBuffer()`
  - `ShareFileClient.downloadToFile()`

##### Following features, interfaces, classes or functions are only available in browsers

N/A

### JavaScript Bundle

To use this client library in the browser, first you need to use a bundler. For details on how to do this, please refer to our [bundling documentation](https://aka.ms/AzureSDKBundling).

### CORS

You need to set up [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/cross-origin-resource-sharing--cors--support-for-the-azure-storage-services) rules for your storage account if you need to develop for browsers. Go to Azure portal and Azure Storage Explorer, find your storage account, create new CORS rules for blob/queue/file/table service(s).

For example, you can create following CORS settings for debugging. But please customize the settings carefully according to your requirements in production environment.

- Allowed origins: \*
- Allowed verbs: DELETE,GET,HEAD,MERGE,POST,OPTIONS,PUT
- Allowed headers: \*
- Exposed headers: \*
- Maximum age (seconds): 86400

## Key concepts

The following components and their corresponding client libraries make up the Azure Storage File Share service:

- The _storage account_ itself, represented by a `ShareServiceClient`
- A _file share_ within the storage account, represented by a `ShareClient`
- An optional _hierarchy of directories_ within the file share, represented by `ShareDirectoryClient` instances
- A _file_ within the file share, which may be up to 1 TiB in size, represented by a `ShareFileClient`

- [Create the share service client](#create-the-share-service-client)
- [List shares in the account](#list-shares-in-the-account)
- [Create a new share and a directory](#create-a-new-share-and-a-directory)
- [Create an azure file then upload to it](#create-an-azure-file-then-upload-to-it)
- [List files and directories under a directory](#list-files-and-directories-under-a-directory)
- [Download a file and convert it to a string (Node.js)](#download-a-file-and-convert-it-to-a-string-nodejs)
- [Download a file and convert it to a string (Browsers)](#download-a-file-and-convert-it-to-a-string-browsers)

### Import the package

To use the clients, import the package into your file:

```javascript
const AzureStorageFileShare = require("@azure/storage-file-share");
```

Alternative, selectively import only the types you need:

```javascript
const { ShareServiceClient, StorageSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/storage-file-share");
```

### Create the share service client

The `ShareServiceClient` requires an URL to the file share service and an access credential. It also optionally accepts some settings in the `options` parameter.

#### using connection string

Alternatively, you can instantiate a `ShareServiceClient` using the `fromConnectionString()` static method with the full connection string as the argument. (The connection string can be obtained from the azure portal.)

```javascript
const { ShareServiceClient } = require("@azure/storage-file-share");

const connStr = "<connection string>";

const shareServiceClient = ShareServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connStr);
```

#### with `StorageSharedKeyCredential`

Pass in a `StorageSharedKeyCredential` with your account name and account key. (The account-name and account-key can be obtained from the azure portal.)

```javascript
const { ShareServiceClient, StorageSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/storage-file-share");

// Enter your storage account name and shared key
const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";

// Use StorageSharedKeyCredential with storage account and account key
// StorageSharedKeyCredential is only available in Node.js runtime, not in browsers
const credential = new StorageSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const serviceClient = new ShareServiceClient(
  // When using AnonymousCredential, following url should include a valid SAS
  `https://${account}.file.core.windows.net`,
  credential
);
```

#### with SAS Token

Also, You can instantiate a `ShareServiceClient` with a shared access signatures (SAS). You can get the SAS token from the Azure Portal or generate one using `generateAccountSASQueryParameters()`.

```javascript
const { ShareServiceClient } = require("@azure/storage-file-share");

const account = "<account name>";
const sas = "<service Shared Access Signature Token>";

const serviceClientWithSAS = new ShareServiceClient(
  `https://${account}.file.core.windows.net${sas}`
);
```

### List shares in the account

Use `ShareServiceClient.listShares()` to iterator shares in this account,
with the new `for-await-of` syntax:

```javascript
const { ShareServiceClient, StorageSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/storage-file-share");

const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";

const credential = new StorageSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const serviceClient = new ShareServiceClient(
  `https://${account}.file.core.windows.net`,
  credential
);

async function main() {
  let shareIter = serviceClient.listShares();
  let i = 1;
  for await (const share of shareIter) {
    console.log(`Share${i}: ${share.name}`);
    i++;
  }
}

main();
```

Alternatively without `for-await-of`:

```javascript
const { ShareServiceClient, StorageSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/storage-file-share");

const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";

const credential = new StorageSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const serviceClient = new ShareServiceClient(
  `https://${account}.file.core.windows.net`,
  credential
);

async function main() {
  let shareIter = serviceClient.listShares();
  let i = 1;
  let shareItem = await shareIter.next();
  while (!shareItem.done) {
    console.log(`Share ${i++}: ${shareItem.value.name}`);
    shareItem = await shareIter.next();
  }
}

main();
```

### Create a new share and a directory

```javascript
const { ShareServiceClient, StorageSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/storage-file-share");

const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";

const credential = new StorageSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const serviceClient = new ShareServiceClient(
  `https://${account}.file.core.windows.net`,
  credential
);

async function main() {
  const shareName = `newshare${new Date().getTime()}`;
  const shareClient = serviceClient.getShareClient(shareName);
  await shareClient.create();
  console.log(`Create share ${shareName} successfully`);

  const directoryName = `newdirectory${new Date().getTime()}`;
  const directoryClient = shareClient.getDirectoryClient(directoryName);
  await directoryClient.create();
  console.log(`Create directory ${directoryName} successfully`);
}

main();
```

### Create an azure file then upload to it

```javascript
const { ShareServiceClient, StorageSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/storage-file-share");

const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";

const credential = new StorageSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const serviceClient = new ShareServiceClient(
  `https://${account}.file.core.windows.net`,
  credential
);

const shareName = "<share name>";
const directoryName = "<directory name>";

async function main() {
  const directoryClient = serviceClient.getShareClient(shareName).getDirectoryClient(directoryName);

  const content = "Hello World!";
  const fileName = "newfile" + new Date().getTime();
  const fileClient = directoryClient.getFileClient(fileName);
  await fileClient.create(content.length);
  console.log(`Create file ${fileName} successfully`);

  // Upload file range
  await fileClient.uploadRange(content, 0, content.length);
  console.log(`Upload file range "${content}" to ${fileName} successfully`);
}

main();
```

### List files and directories under a directory

Use `DirectoryClient.listFilesAndDirectories()` to iterator over files and directories,
with the new `for-await-of` syntax. The `kind` property can be used to identify whether
a iterm is a directory or a file.

```javascript
const { ShareServiceClient, StorageSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/storage-file-share");

const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";

const credential = new StorageSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const serviceClient = new ShareServiceClient(
  `https://${account}.file.core.windows.net`,
  credential
);

const shareName = "<share name>";
const directoryName = "<directory name>";

async function main() {
  const directoryClient = serviceClient.getShareClient(shareName).getDirectoryClient(directoryName);

  let dirIter = directoryClient.listFilesAndDirectories();
  let i = 1;
  for await (const item of dirIter) {
    if (item.kind === "directory") {
      console.log(`${i} - directory\t: ${item.name}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`${i} - file\t: ${item.name}`);
    }
    i++;
  }
}

main();
```

Alternatively without using `for-await-of`:

```javascript
const { ShareServiceClient, StorageSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/storage-file-share");

const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";

const credential = new StorageSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const serviceClient = new ShareServiceClient(
  `https://${account}.file.core.windows.net`,
  credential
);

const shareName = "<share name>";
const directoryName = "<directory name>";

async function main() {
  const directoryClient = serviceClient.getShareClient(shareName).getDirectoryClient(directoryName);

  let dirIter = directoryClient.listFilesAndDirectories();
  let i = 1;
  let item = await dirIter.next();
  while (!item.done) {
    if (item.value.kind === "directory") {
      console.log(`${i} - directory\t: ${item.value.name}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`${i} - file\t: ${item.value.name}`);
    }
    item = await dirIter.next();
  }
}

main();
```

For a complete sample on iterating please see [samples/typescript/src/iterators-files-and-directories.ts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/sdk/storage/storage-file-share/samples/typescript/src/iterators-files-and-directories.ts).

### Download a file and convert it to a string (Node.js)

```javascript
const { ShareServiceClient, StorageSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/storage-file-share");

const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";

const credential = new StorageSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const serviceClient = new ShareServiceClient(
  `https://${account}.file.core.windows.net`,
  credential
);

const shareName = "<share name>";
const fileName = "<file name>";

// [Node.js only] A helper method used to read a Node.js readable stream into a Buffer
async function streamToBuffer(readableStream) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const chunks = [];
    readableStream.on("data", (data) => {
      chunks.push(data instanceof Buffer ? data : Buffer.from(data));
    });
    readableStream.on("end", () => {
      resolve(Buffer.concat(chunks));
    });
    readableStream.on("error", reject);
  });
}

async function main() {
  const fileClient = serviceClient
    .getShareClient(shareName)
    .rootDirectoryClient.getFileClient(fileName);

  // Get file content from position 0 to the end
  // In Node.js, get downloaded data by accessing downloadFileResponse.readableStreamBody
  const downloadFileResponse = await fileClient.download();
  console.log(
    `Downloaded file content: ${(
      await streamToBuffer(downloadFileResponse.readableStreamBody)
    ).toString()}`
  );
}

main();
```

### Download a file and convert it to a string (Browsers)

Please refer to the [JavaScript Bundle](#javascript-bundle) section for more information on using this library in the browser.

```javascript
const { ShareServiceClient } = require("@azure/storage-file-share");

const account = "<account name>";
const sas = "<service Shared Access Signature Token>";
const shareName = "<share name>";
const fileName = "<file name>";

const serviceClient = new ShareServiceClient(`https://${account}.file.core.windows.net${sas}`);

async function main() {
  const fileClient = serviceClient
    .getShareClient(shareName)
    .rootDirectoryClient.getFileClient(fileName);

  // Get file content from position 0 to the end
  // In browsers, get downloaded data by accessing downloadFileResponse.blobBody
  const downloadFileResponse = await fileClient.download(0);
  console.log(
    `Downloaded file content: ${await blobToString(await downloadFileResponse.blobBody)}`
  );
}

// [Browser only] A helper method used to convert a browser Blob into string.
async function blobToString(blob) {
  const fileReader = new FileReader();
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fileReader.onloadend = (ev) => {
      resolve(ev.target.result);
    };
    fileReader.onerror = reject;
    fileReader.readAsText(blob);
  });
}

main();
```

A complete example of basic scenarios is at [samples/typescript/src/basic.ts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/sdk/storage/storage-file-share/samples/typescript/src/basic.ts).

## Troubleshooting

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling `setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```javascript
import { setLogLevel } from "@azure/logger";

setLogLevel("info");
```
