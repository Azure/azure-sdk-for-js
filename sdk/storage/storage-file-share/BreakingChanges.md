# Breaking Changes

## 2019.11 12.0.0-preview.6

- `@azure/storage-file` package is renamed to `@azure/storage-file-share` to better align with the upcoming new package for Azure Storage Files DataLake. As a consequence,
  - `FileServiceClient` becomes `ShareServiceClient`
  - `DirectoryClient` becomes `ShareDirectoryClient`
  - `FileClient` becomes `ShareFileClient`
- [Breaking] The custom browser and retry policies that are specific to the Storage libraries have been
renamed to have the `Storage` prefix. [PR 5862](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/5862). 
Below are the entities that now have the Storage prefix
   - BrowserPolicy
   - BrowserPolicyFactory
   - RetryPolicy
   - RetryPolicyType
   - RetryOptions
   - RetryPolicyFactory
- The properties in the StoragePipelineOptions interface have been updated as below:
   - The `proxy` property of type `ProxySettings | string` has been renamed to `proxyOptions` and
 will be of type `ProxyOptions`. If you have been passing url directly, split the value into `host`
 and `port` then pass it as a json object.
   - The `telemetry` property of type `TelemetryOptions` has been renamed to `userAgentOptions` of
 type `UserAgentOptions`.
    - The `logger` is no longer a property available to configure. To enable logging, please see the
[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/0ddc2f3c3d4658b20d96910acc37a77e5209e5e3/sdk/storage/storage-queue/README.md#troubleshooting) section of our readme.
- [Breaking] The `UniqueRequestIdPolicy` and `KeepAlivePolicy` are no longer exported from this library. The
 corresponding policies from the `@azure/core-http` library are meant to be used instead.

    include: ["metadata", "snapshots"]

  ```

### 2019.08 Version 12.0.0-preview.2

- Aborter class is no longer exposed from the package. Use the package [@azure/abort-controller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/abort-controller) to pass an abort signal to any of the async operations.

- `Models.StorageServiceProperties` is renamed into `Models.FileServiceProperties`

### 2019.07 Version 12.0.0-preview.1

- Client types are renamed from *URL to *Client.
  - ServiceURL, ShareURL, DirectoryURL and FileURL to ServiceClient to FileServiceClient, ShareClient, DirectoryClient and FileClient respectively.
- Aborter parameters are now moved into option bags.
  - `abortSignal` attrubute(optional) in the option-bag of respective module has to be utitlized for the `Aborter.timeout(<milliseconds>)` functionality.
  - `Aborter.none` is the default value.
- I- prefixes are removed from interface names.
  - Example- `IDirectoryCreateOptions` is updated to `DirectoryCreateOptions`, the new names have to be used.
- The static methods to create client types are removed. The functionality is moved into new instance methods added to the parent clients.
- The telemetry strings have been updated.
  - `Azure-Storage/${SDK_VERSION}` is updated to `azsdk-js-storageblob/${SDK_VERSION}`.
- `withPipeline()` method is removed.
- Methods that list segments(`listFilesAndDirectoriesSegment()` and `listSharesSegment()`) are no longer exposed in public api.
- High level convenience functions are moved into clients as their instance member function.
  - `uploadFileToAzureFile()`, `uploadStreamToAzureFile()`, `downloadAzureFileToBuffer()` and `uploadBrowserDataToAzureFile()` -> `FileClient.uploadFile()`,
    `FileClient.uploadStream()`, `FileClient.downloadToBuffer()` and `FileClient.uploadBrowserData()` respectively.
- `StorageClient` is no longer exposed. `StorageClient.newPipeline()` static method is moved to the top level exported function `newPipeline()`.

### 2019.01 Version 10.1.0

- Updated convenience layer methods enum type parameters into typescript union types, this will help reducing bundle footprint.
- Updated URL encoding strategy for `url` parameters of `new XXXURL(url, pipeline)` methods, such as `new FileURL(url, pipeline)`.
