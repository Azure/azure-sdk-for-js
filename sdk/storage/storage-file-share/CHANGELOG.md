## 10.2.0 (2019-06-01)

- Fixed a bug of `downloadBlobToBuffer()` and `downloadAzureFileToBuffer()` when provided offset is not 0.
- Fixed a bug that `Aborter` cannot work during retry interval.
- Fixed a bug that `Aborter` throws timeout error even though it succeeds of `FileURL.download()`.
- Fixed a bug that "err.code.toUpperCase is not a function" when retries in browser.
- `Aborter` doesn't require `dom` as tsconfig lib requirement anymore for `Event` type.
- Export `RetryPolicyType`.
- Updated HTTP client from axios to node-fetch in Node.js runtime.
- A new option `keepAliveOptions` added to parameter of `StorageURL.newPipeline()` which controls keep-alive configurations. Keep-alive is enabled by default.
- Updated Azure Storage Service API version to [2018-11-09](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/version-2018-11-09).
- The `ShareURL.getStatistics()` now returns the approximate size in bytes with `shareUsageBytes`.
- Added `DirectoryURL.listHandlesSegment()` and `FileURL.listHandlesSegment()` to returns a list of open handles on a directory or a file.
- Added `DirectoryURL.forceCloseHandlesSegment()`, `FileURL.forceCloseHandlesSegment()`, `DirectoryURL.forceCloseHandle()` and `FileURL.forceCloseHandle()` to close handles.
- Updated Azure Storage Service API version to [2018-11-09](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/version-2018-11-09).

## 10.1.0 (2019-01-01)

- [Breaking] Updated convenience layer methods enum type parameters into typescript union types, this will help reducing bundle footprint.
- [Breaking] Updated URL encoding strategy for `url` parameters of `new XXXURL(url, pipeline)` methods, such as `new FileURL(url, pipeline)`.
  - URL will accept both encoded or non-encoded URL string. It will escape non-escaped special characters, like Chinese characters. However, if directory/file name includes `%`, `url` must be encoded manually.
- [Breaking] `SASQueryParameters` is not going to be exported in browser bundle, and will be exported in Node.js runtime.
- [Breaking] IE11 needs `Array.prototype.includes` and `Object.keys` polyfills loaded.
- Updated dependency `ms-rest-js` to `@azure/ms-rest-js`.
- Fixed `Aborter.timeout()` misleading scale description.
- Removed default 60s server timeout value for retry options `tryTimeoutInMs` to avoid large blob download stream unexpected ending.
- Fixed an issue that when body is string with special characters, `FileURL.uploadRange` will fail to upload.
- Exported `HttpRequestBody` type for who wants to implement a customized HTTP client.
