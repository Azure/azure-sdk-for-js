# Azure Storage client library for JavaScript

Azure Storage is a Microsoft-managed service providing cloud storage that is highly available, secure, durable, scalable, and redundant.

This project provides client libraries in JavaScript that makes it easy to consume Microsoft Azure Storage service.

### Compatibility

These libraries are compatible with Node.js and browsers, and validated against LTS Node.js versions (>=8.16.0) and latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

## Architecture

The Azure Storage client libraries for JavaScript provides low-level and high-level APIs. Take Blob client library as example:

- `BlobServiceClient`, `ContainerClient` and `BlobClient` objects provide the low-level API functionality and map one-to-one to the [Azure Storage Blob REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api).

- The high-level APIs provide convenience abstractions such as uploading a large stream to a block blob (using multiple PutBlock requests).
