## 12.0.0 (2020.03)

- Added exists() on `FileSystemClient` and `PathClient`.
- Added high level upload and download methods to `DataLakeFileClient`.

## 12.0.0-preview.8 (2020.02)

- Updated Azure Storage Service API version to 2019-07-07.
- Fixed a bug where the package didn't work as expected when bundling web applications. [PR #7298](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/7298)

## 12.0.0-preview.7 (2020.01)

- Bug fix - Name properties on clients now support more kinds of endpoints(IPv4/v6 hosts, single word domains). [PR #6753](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/6753)
- Service clients now share a single http client instance by default. [PR #6657](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/6657)

  Previously, a new http client was created for each service client if none was provided by the user. This could result in TCP port exhaustion under heavy usage with the keepAlive option enabled because each http client has its own persistent TCP connection. This change creates a single http client instance which is shared among all service clients by default.

## 12.0.0-preview.6 (2019-12-04)

- Initial Release. API version 2019-02-02 supported. Please see the README for information on the new design.
