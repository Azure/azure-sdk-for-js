- Service clients now share a single http client instance by default. [PR #6657](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/6657)

  Previously, a new http client was created for each service client if none was provided by the user. This could result in TCP port exhaustion under heavy usage with the keepAlive option enabled because each http client has its own persistent TCP connection. This change creates a single http client instance which is shared among all service clients by default.

## 12.0.0-preview.6 (2019-12-04)

- Initial Release. API version 2019-02-02 supported. Please see the README for information on the new design.
