# Changelog

## 2019.09 12.0.0-preview.3

- [Breaking] `RawTokenCredential` is dropped. TokenCredential implementations can be found in the [@azure/identity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity) library for authentication.
- Updated Azure Storage Service API version to 2019-02-02.
- A new API `BlobServiceClient.submitBatch()` supports Blob Batch operation which allows multiple requests to be sent within a single request body.
- Added support for customer provided encryption key.
- Added support for rehydrate priority with additional option to methods `BlobClient.startCopyFromURL()` and `BlobClient.setTier()`.
- APIs `BlobClient.startCopyFromURL()`, `BlockBlobClient.upload()`, `BlockBlobClient.commitBlockList()` and `PageBlobClient.create()` now support set the blob tier within the API call.
- Responses for all APIs now return x-ms-client-request-id through `clientRequestId` that was passed in on the request from client-side.
- Exposed options to accept CRC64 as a transactional data integrity mechanism for data transfer APIs.
- Added overloads of `generateBlobSASQueryParameters` functions to generate user delegation SAS.
- `expiry` and `start` in `AccessPolicy` are now optional in `ContainerClient.setAccessPolicy` and `ContainerClient.getAccessPolicy`.

### 2019.08 12.0.0-preview.2

- [Breaking] Aborter class is no longer exposed from the package. Use the package [@azure/abort-controller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/abort-controller) to pass an abort signal to any of the async operations.
  `AbortController.timeout(<milliseconds>)` can be utitlized as an abort signal.
- Generalized the credential parameter in client constructors to support `{SharedKeyCredential | AnonymousCredential | TokenCredential}` credentials as a union type.
- Storage service allows SAS connection string with SAS string and endpoints along with the Account connection string(account name, key and endpoint).
  In this preview, SAS connection string support is added to the existing connection string client constructors and static methods.
- Account connection string example - `DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=myaccount;AccountKey=accountKey;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net`
- SAS connection string example - `BlobEndpoint=https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/;QueueEndpoint=https://myaccount.queue.core.windows.net/;FileEndpoint=https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/;TableEndpoint=https://myaccount.table.core.windows.net/;SharedAccessSignature=sasString`
- SAS connection string is supported in both NodeJS and browser runtimes unlike the Account Connection String which is supported only in the NodeJS runtime.

- A new API `BlobServiceClient.getUserDelegationKey()` added to get a key that can be used to generate a user delegation SAS (shared access signature).
- Updated HTTP client from axios to node-fetch in Node.js runtime.
- A new option `keepAliveOptions` added to parameter of `newPipeline()` which controls keep-alive configurations. Keep-alive is enabled by default.
- Pass through `options.abortSignal` to the optional `abortSignal` attribute in option bags instead of using `AbortSignal.none` as the default value when `options.abortSignal` is not specified.
- Basic HTTP proxy authentication support is added. Proxy settings can be passed in the options while creating a new client. Example - [typescript/proxyAuth.ts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/feature/storage/sdk/storage/storage-blob/samples/typescript/proxyAuth.ts)
- Connection strings for explicit storage endpoints are supported. - [Configure Azure Storage connection strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string#create-a-connection-string-for-an-explicit-storage-endpoint)
