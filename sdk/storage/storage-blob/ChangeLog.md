### 2018.12 10.3.0

- [Breaking] Updated convenience layer methods enum type parameters into typescript union types, this will help reducing bundle footprint.
- [Breaking] Updated URL encoding strategy for `url` parameters of `new XXXURL(url, pipeline)` methods, such as `new BlobURL(url, pipeline)`.
  - URL will accept both encoded or non-encoded URL string. It will escape non-escaped special characters, like Chinese characters. However, if blob name includes `?` or `%`, `url` must be encoded manually.
- [Breaking] `SASQueryParameters` is not going to be exported in browser bundle, and will be exported in Node.js runtime.
- [Breaking] IE11 needs `Array.prototype.includes` and `Object.keys` polyfills loaded.
- Updated dependency `ms-rest-js` to `@azure/ms-rest-js`.
- Fixed `Aborter.timeout()` misleading scale description.
- Added option `maxSingleShotSize` to customize concurrency upload threshold in bytes for highlevel uploading APIs, like `uploadBrowserDataToBlockBlob` or `uploadFileToBlockBlob`.
- Removed default 60s server timeout value for retry options `tryTimeoutInMs` to avoid large blob download stream unexcepted ending.
- Fixed an issue that when body is string with special characters, `BlockBlobULR.upload` will fail to upload.

### 2018.11 10.2.0-preview

- [Breaking] Updated names of exported interfaces `IHTTPPipelineLogger` & `IHTTPClient` to `IHttpPipelineLogger` & `IHttpClient`.
- [Breaking] For `setMetadata()` and `setHTTPHeaders()`, `metadata` and `blobHTTPHeaders` are moved from `options` into top level parameter list.
- Fixed bugs and typos in samples.
- Fixed a bug during generateAccountSASQueryParameters() that generated signature is not valid.
- Fixed a bug during generateBlobSASQueryParameters() that cache-control, content-type, content-disposition, content-encoding and content-language are not supported.
- Fixed a bug in SAS generation that start and expiry time format is not correct.
- Removed `File` from `uploadBrowserDataToBlockBlob` parameter type list, because `File` extends `Blob` which is already in the list.
- Fixed typos in `IRange` comments.
- Removed useless `marker` field from option of `ServiceURL.listContainersSegment` method.
- Fixed a bug that `timeout` parameter should use second as unit instead of millisecond.
- Added stream retry when `BlobURL.download` response stream unexcepted ends.
