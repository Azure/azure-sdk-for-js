- [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40azure%2Fstorage-blob.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40azure%2Fstorage-blob)
- [API Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/%40azure/storage-blob/index?view=azure-node-preview)
- [Advanced Examples in Wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-js/wiki)

## Introduction

This project provides a SDK in JavaScript that makes it easy to consume Microsoft Azure Storage services.

Please note that this version of the SDK is a compete overhaul of the current [Azure Storage SDK for Node.js and JavaScript in Browsers](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-node), and is based on the new Storage SDK architecture.

### Features

- Blob Storage
  - Get/Set Blob Service Properties
  - Create/List/Delete Containers
  - Create/Read/List/Update/Delete Block Blobs
  - Create/Read/List/Update/Delete Page Blobs
  - Create/Read/List/Update/Delete Append Blobs
- Features new
  - Asynchronous I/O for all operations using the async methods
  - HttpPipeline which enables a high degree of per-request configurability
  - 1-to-1 correlation with the Storage REST API for clarity and simplicity

### Compatibility

This SDK is compatible with Node.js and browsers, and validated against LTS Node.js versions (>=6.5) and latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

#### Compatible with IE11

You need polyfills to make this library work with IE11. The easiest way is to use [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill), or [polyfill service](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/).
Or you can load separate polyfills for missed ES feature(s).
This library depends on following ES features which need external polyfills loaded.

- `Promise`
- `String.prototype.startsWith`
- `String.prototype.endsWith`
- `String.prototype.repeat`
- `String.prototype.includes`
- `Array.prototype.includes`
- `Object.keys` (Override IE11's `Object.keys` with ES6 polyfill forcely to enable [ES6 behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys#Notes))

#### Differences between Node.js and browsers

There are differences between Node.js and browsers runtime. When getting start with this SDK, pay attention to APIs or classes marked with _"ONLY AVAILABLE IN NODE.JS RUNTIME"_ or _"ONLY AVAILABLE IN BROWSERS"_.

##### Following features, interfaces, classes or functions are only available in Node.js

- Shared Key Authorization based on account name and account key
  - `SharedKeyCredential`
- Shared Access Signature(SAS) generation
  - `generateAccountSASQueryParameters()`
  - `generateBlobSASQueryParameters()`
- Parallel uploading and downloading
  - `uploadFileToBlockBlob()`
  - `uploadStreamToBlockBlob()`
  - `downloadBlobToBuffer()`

##### Following features, interfaces, classes or functions are only available in browsers

- Parallel uploading and downloading
  - `uploadBrowserDataToBlockBlob()`

## Getting Started

### NPM

The preferred way to install the Azure Storage SDK for JavaScript is to use the npm package manager. Simply type the following into a terminal window:

```bash
npm install @azure/storage-blob
```

In your TypeScript or JavaScript file, import via following:

```JavaScript
import * as Azure from "@azure/storage-blob";
```

Or

```JavaScript
const Azure = require("@azure/storage-blob");
```

### JavaScript Bundle

To use the SDK with JS bundle in the browsers, simply add a script tag to your HTML pages pointing to the downloaded JS bundle file(s):

```html
<script src="https://mydomain/azure-storage-blob.min.js"></script>
```

The JS bundled file is compatible with [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) standard, if no module system found, following global variable(s) will be exported:

- `azblob`

#### Download

Download latest released JS bundles from links in the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/releases). Or from following links directly:

- Blob [https://aka.ms/downloadazurestoragejsblob](https://aka.ms/downloadazurestoragejsblob)

### CORS

You need to set up [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/rest/api/storageservices/cross-origin-resource-sharing--cors--support-for-the-azure-storage-services) rules for your storage account if you need to develop for browsers. Go to Azure portal and Azure Storage Explorer, find your storage account, create new CORS rules for blob/queue/file/table service(s).

For example, you can create following CORS settings for debugging. But please customize the settings carefully according to your requirements in production environment.

- Allowed origins: \*
- Allowed verbs: DELETE,GET,HEAD,MERGE,POST,OPTIONS,PUT
- Allowed headers: \*
- Exposed headers: \*
- Maximum age (seconds): 86400

## SDK Architecture

The Azure Storage SDK for JavaScript provides low-level and high-level APIs.

- ServiceURL, ContainerURL and BlobURL objects provide the low-level API functionality and map one-to-one to the [Azure Storage Blob REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api).

- The high-level APIs provide convenience abstractions such as uploading a large stream to a block blob (using multiple PutBlock requests).

## Code Samples

```javascript
const {
  Aborter,
  BlobURL,
  BlockBlobURL,
  ContainerURL,
  ServiceURL,
  StorageURL,
  SharedKeyCredential,
  AnonymousCredential,
  TokenCredential
} = require("@azure/storage-blob");

async function main() {
  // Enter your storage account name and shared key
  const account = "account";
  const accountKey = "accountkey";

  // Use SharedKeyCredential with storage account and account key
  const sharedKeyCredential = new SharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);

  // Use TokenCredential with OAuth token
  const tokenCredential = new TokenCredential("token");
  tokenCredential.token = "renewedToken"; // Renew the token by updating token field of token credential

  // Use AnonymousCredential when url already includes a SAS signature
  const anonymousCredential = new AnonymousCredential();

  // Use sharedKeyCredential, tokenCredential or anonymousCredential to create a pipeline
  const pipeline = StorageURL.newPipeline(sharedKeyCredential);

  // List containers
  const serviceURL = new ServiceURL(
    // When using AnonymousCredential, following url should include a valid SAS or support public access
    `https://${account}.blob.core.windows.net`,
    pipeline
  );

  let marker;
  do {
    const listContainersResponse = await serviceURL.listContainersSegment(
      Aborter.none,
      marker
    );

    marker = listContainersResponse.nextMarker;
    for (const container of listContainersResponse.containerItems) {
      console.log(`Container: ${container.name}`);
    }
  } while (marker);

  // Create a container
  const containerName = `newcontainer${new Date().getTime()}`;
  const containerURL = ContainerURL.fromServiceURL(serviceURL, containerName);

  const createContainerResponse = await containerURL.create(Aborter.none);
  console.log(
    `Create container ${containerName} successfully`,
    createContainerResponse.requestId
  );

  // Create a blob
  const content = "hello";
  const blobName = "newblob" + new Date().getTime();
  const blobURL = BlobURL.fromContainerURL(containerURL, blobName);
  const blockBlobURL = BlockBlobURL.fromBlobURL(blobURL);
  const uploadBlobResponse = await blockBlobURL.upload(
    Aborter.none,
    content,
    content.length
  );
  console.log(
    `Upload block blob ${blobName} successfully`,
    uploadBlobResponse.requestId
  );

  // List blobs
  marker = undefined;
  do {
    const listBlobsResponse = await containerURL.listBlobFlatSegment(
      Aborter.none,
      marker
    );

    marker = listBlobsResponse.nextMarker;
    for (const blob of listBlobsResponse.segment.blobItems) {
      console.log(`Blob: ${blob.name}`);
    }
  } while (marker);

  // Get blob content from position 0 to the end
  // In Node.js, get downloaded data by accessing downloadBlockBlobResponse.readableStreamBody
  // In browsers, get downloaded data by accessing downloadBlockBlobResponse.blobBody
  const downloadBlockBlobResponse = await blobURL.download(Aborter.none, 0);
  console.log(
    "Downloaded blob content",
    await streamToString(downloadBlockBlobResponse.readableStreamBody)
  );

  // Delete container
  await containerURL.delete(Aborter.none);

  console.log("deleted container");
}

// A helper method used to read a Node.js readable stream into string
async function streamToString(readableStream) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const chunks = [];
    readableStream.on("data", data => {
      chunks.push(data.toString());
    });
    readableStream.on("end", () => {
      resolve(chunks.join(""));
    });
    readableStream.on("error", reject);
  });
}

// An async method returns a Promise object, which is compatible with then().catch() coding style.
main()
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Successfully executed sample.");
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err.message);
  });
```
