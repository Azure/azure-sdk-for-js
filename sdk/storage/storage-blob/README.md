# Azure Storage client library for JavaScript - Blob

Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that does not adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

This project provides a client library in JavaScript that makes it easy to consume Microsoft Azure Blob Storage service.

### Compatibility

This library is compatible with Node.js and browsers, and validated against LTS Node.js versions (>=8.16.0) and latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

#### Compatible with IE11

You need polyfills to make this library work with IE11. The easiest way is to use [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill), or [polyfill service](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/).

You can also load separate polyfills for missed ES feature(s).
This library depends on following ES features which need external polyfills loaded.

- `Promise`
- `String.prototype.startsWith`
- `String.prototype.endsWith`
- `String.prototype.repeat`
- `String.prototype.includes`
- `Array.prototype.includes`
- `Object.keys` (Override IE11's `Object.keys` with ES6 polyfill forcely to enable [ES6 behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys#Notes))
- `Symbol`

#### Differences between Node.js and browsers

There are differences between Node.js and browsers runtime. When getting started with this library, pay attention to APIs or classes marked with _"ONLY AVAILABLE IN NODE.JS RUNTIME"_ or _"ONLY AVAILABLE IN BROWSERS"_.

##### Following features, interfaces, classes or functions are only available in Node.js

- Shared Key Authorization based on account name and account key
  - `SharedKeyCredential`
- Shared Access Signature(SAS) generation
  - `generateAccountSASQueryParameters()`
  - `generateBlobSASQueryParameters()`
- Parallel uploading and downloading
  - `BlockBlobClient.uploadFile()`
  - `BlockBlobClient.uploadStream()`
  - `BlobClient.downloadToBuffer()`
  - `BlobClient.downloadToFile()`

##### Following features, interfaces, classes or functions are only available in browsers

- Parallel uploading and downloading
  - `BlockBlobClient.uploadBrowserData()`

## Getting started

### NPM

The preferred way to install the Azure Blob Storage client library for JavaScript is to use the npm package manager. Simply type the following into a terminal window:

```bash
npm install @azure/storage-blob@12.0.0-preview.4
```

In your TypeScript or JavaScript file, import via following:

```javascript
import * as Azure from "@azure/storage-blob";
```

Or

```javascript
const Azure = require("@azure/storage-blob");
```

### JavaScript bundle

To use the library with JS bundle in the browsers, simply add a script tag to your HTML pages pointing to the downloaded JS bundle file(s):

```html
<script src="https://mydomain/azure-storage-blob.min.js"></script>
```

The JS bundled file is compatible with [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) standard, if no module system found, following global variable(s) will be exported:

- `azblob`

#### Download

Download latest released JS bundles from links in the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/releases).

### CORS

You need to set up [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/rest/api/storageservices/cross-origin-resource-sharing--cors--support-for-the-azure-storage-services) rules for your storage account if you need to develop for browsers. Go to Azure portal and Azure Storage Explorer, find your storage account, create new CORS rules for blob/queue/file/table service(s).

For example, you can create following CORS settings for debugging. But please customize the settings carefully according to your requirements in production environment.

- Allowed origins: \*
- Allowed verbs: DELETE,GET,HEAD,MERGE,POST,OPTIONS,PUT
- Allowed headers: \*
- Exposed headers: \*
- Maximum age (seconds): 86400

## Examples

Samples can be found at
[Javascript samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/feature/storage/sdk/storage/storage-blob/samples/javascript)
and
[Typescript samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/feature/storage/sdk/storage/storage-blob/samples/typescript)

Below are the snippets to get started with the Azure Storage blob client library.

### Import types

You can use the `const Azure = require("@azure/storage-blob");` shown above then use types and functions from `Azure`.
Or you can selectively import certain types,

```javascript
const { BlobServiceClient, SharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/storage-blob");
);
```

### Create the blob service client

Use the constructor to create a instance of `BlobServiceClient`.

- **Recommended way to instantiate a `BlobServiceClient` - with `DefaultAzureCredential` from `@azure/identity` package**

  Setup : Reference - Authorize access to blobs and queues with Azure Active Directory from a client application - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-app

  - Register a new AAD application and give permissions to access Azure Storage on behalf of the signed-in user

    - Register a new application in the Azure Active Directory(in the azure-portal) - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app
    - In the `API permissions` section, select `Add a permission` and choose `Microsoft APIs`.
    - Pick `Azure Storage` and select the checkbox next to `user_impersonation` and then click `Add permissions`. This would allow the application to access Azure Storage on behalf of the signed-in user.

  - Grant access to Azure Blob data with RBAC in the Azure Portal

    - RBAC roles for blobs and queues - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal.
    - In the azure portal, go to your storage-account and assign **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role to the registered AAD application from `Access control (IAM)` tab (in the left-side-navbar of your storage account in the azure-portal).

  - Environment setup for the sample
    - From the overview page of your AAD Application, note down the `CLIENT ID` and `TENANT ID`. In the "Certificates & Secrets" tab, create a secret and note that down.
    - Make sure you have AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET as environment variables to successfully execute the sample(Can leverage process.env).

  ```javascript
  const account = "";
  const defaultAzureCredential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

  const blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(
    `https://${account}.blob.core.windows.net`,
    defaultAzureCredential
  );
  ```
  [Note - Above steps are only for Node.js]
- Alternatively, you instantiate a `BlobServiceClient` with a `SharedKeyCredential` by passing account-name and account-key as arguments. (account-name and account-key can be obtained from the azure portal)
  [ONLY AVAILABLE IN NODE.JS RUNTIME]

  ```javascript
  // Enter your storage account name and shared key
  const account = "account";
  const accountKey = "accountkey";

  // Use SharedKeyCredential with storage account and account key
  // SharedKeyCredential is only avaiable in Node.js runtime, not in browsers
  const sharedKeyCredential = new SharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
  const blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(
    `https://${account}.blob.core.windows.net`,
    sharedKeyCredential
  );
  ```

### Create a new container

Use `BlobServiceClient.getContainerClient()` to get a container client instance then create a new container resource.

```javascript
// Create a container
const containerName = `newcontainer${new Date().getTime()}`;
const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(containerName);
const createContainerResponse = await containerClient.create();
console.log(`Create container ${containerName} successfully`, createContainerResponse.requestId);
```

### List the containers

Use `BlobServiceClient.listContainers()` function to iterate the containers,
with the new `for-await-of` syntax:

```javascript
let i = 1;
let iter = await blobServiceClient.listContainers();
for await (const container of iter) {
  console.log(`Container ${i++}: ${container.name}`);
}
```

Alternatively without using `for-await-of`:

```javascript
let i = 1;
let iter = blobServiceClient.listContainers();
let containerItem = await iter.next();
while (!containerItem.done) {
  console.log(`Container ${i++}: ${containerItem.value.name}`);
  containerItem = await iter.next();
}
```

In addition, pagination is supported for listing too via `byPage()`:

```javascript
let i = 1;
for await (const response of blobServiceClient.listContainers().byPage({ maxPageSize: 20 })) {
  if (response.containerItems) {
    for (const container of response.containerItems) {
      console.log(`Container ${i++}: ${container.name}`);
    }
  }
}
```

For a complete sample on iterating containers please see [samples/iterators-containers.ts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/feature/storage/sdk/storage/storage-blob/samples/typescript/iterators-containers.ts).

### Create a blob by uploading data to

```javascript
const content = "hello";
const blobName = "newblob" + new Date().getTime();
const blobClient = containerClient.getBlobClient(blobName);
const blockBlobClient = blobClient.getBlockBlobClient();
const uploadBlobResponse = await blockBlobClient.upload(content, content.length);
console.log(`Upload block blob ${blobName} successfully`, uploadBlobResponse.requestId);
```

### List blobs inside a container

Similar to listing containers.

```javascript
let i = 1;
let iter = await containerClient.listBlobsFlat();
for await (const blob of iter) {
  console.log(`Blob ${i++}: ${blob.name}`);
}
```

For a complete sample on iterating blobs please see [samples/iterators-blobs.ts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/feature/storage/sdk/storage/storage-blob/samples/typescript/iterators-blobs.ts).

### Download a blob and convert it to a string (Node.js)

```javascript
// Get blob content from position 0 to the end
// In Node.js, get downloaded data by accessing downloadBlockBlobResponse.readableStreamBody
const downloadBlockBlobResponse = await blobClient.download();
const downloaded = await streamToString(downloadBlockBlobResponse.readableStreamBody);
console.log(
  "Downloaded blob content:",
  downloaded
);

// [Node.js only] A helper method used to read a Node.js readable stream into string
async function streamToString(readableStream) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const chunks = [];
    readableStream.on("data", (data) => {
      chunks.push(data.toString());
    });
    readableStream.on("end", () => {
      resolve(chunks.join(""));
    });
    readableStream.on("error", reject);
  });
}
```

### Download a blob and convert it to a string (Browsers)

```javascript
  // Get blob content from position 0 to the end
  // In browsers, get downloaded data by accessing downloadBlockBlobResponse.blobBody
  const downloadBlockBlobResponse = await blobClient.download();
  const downloaded = await blobToString(downloadBlockBlobResponse.blobBody);
  console.log(
    "Downloaded blob content",
    downloaded
  );

// [Browsers only] A helper method used to convert a browser Blob into string.
export async function blobToString(blob: Blob): Promise<string> {
  const fileReader = new FileReader();
  return new Promise<string>((resolve, reject) => {
    fileReader.onloadend = (ev: any) => {
      resolve(ev.target!.result);
    };
    fileReader.onerror = reject;
    fileReader.readAsText(blob);
  });
}
```

A complete example of basic scenarios is at [samples/basic.ts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/feature/storage/sdk/storage/storage-blob/samples/typescript/basic.ts).

## Troubleshooting

It could help diagnozing issues by turning on the console logging. Here's an example logger implementation. First, add a custom logger:

```javascript
class ConsoleHttpPipelineLogger {
  constructor(minimumLogLevel) {
    this.minimumLogLevel = minimumLogLevel;
  }
  log(logLevel, message) {
    const logMessage = `${new Date().toISOString()} ${HttpPipelineLogLevel[logLevel]}: ${message}`;
    switch (logLevel) {
      case HttpPipelineLogLevel.ERROR:
        console.error(logMessage);
        break;
      case HttpPipelineLogLevel.WARNING:
        console.warn(logMessage);
        break;
      case HttpPipelineLogLevel.INFO:
        console.log(logMessage);
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

Then when creating the `BlobServiceClient` instance, pass the logger in the options

```javascript
const blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(
  `https://${account}.blob.core.windows.net`,
  sharedKeyCredential,
  {
    logger: new ConsoleHttpPipelineLogger(HttpPipelineLogLevel.INFO)
  }
);
```

## Authenticating with Azure Active Directory

If you have [registered an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) with an Azure Active Directory tenant, you can [assign it to an RBAC role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad) in your Azure Storage account. This enables you to use the Azure.Identity library to authenticate with Azure Storage as shown in the [azureAdAuth.ts sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/feature/storage/sdk/storage/storage-blob/samples/typescript/azureAdAuth.ts).
