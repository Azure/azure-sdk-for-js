# Changelog

### 2019.08 Version 12.0.0-preview.3

- [Breaking] `RawTokenCredential` is dropped. TokenCredential implementations can be found in the [@azure/identity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity) library for authentication.

- Pass through `options.abortSignal` to the optional `abortSignal` attribute in option bags instead of using `AbortSignal.none` as the default value when `options.abortSignal` is not specified.

### 2019.08 Version 12.0.0-preview.2

- [Breaking] Aborter class is no longer exposed from the package. Use the package [@azure/abort-controller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/abort-controller) to pass an abort signal to any of the async operations.
  `AbortController.timeout(<milliseconds>)` can be utitlized as an abort signal.
- Generalized the credential parameter in client constructors to support `{SharedKeyCredential | AnonymousCredential | TokenCredential}` credentials as a union type.
- Storage service allows SAS connection string with SAS string and endpoints along with the Account connection string(account name, key and endpoint).
  In this preview, SAS connection string support is added to the existing connection string client constructors and static methods.
  - Account connection string example - `DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=myaccount;AccountKey=accountKey;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net`
  - SAS connection string example - `BlobEndpoint=https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/;QueueEndpoint=https://myaccount.queue.core.windows.net/;FileEndpoint=https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/;TableEndpoint=https://myaccount.table.core.windows.net/;SharedAccessSignature=sasString`
  - SAS connection string is supported in both NodeJS and browser runtimes unlike the Account Connection String which is supported only in the NodeJS runtime.
- Fixed a bug where `MessageIdClient` constructor throws an error `URL is undefined` when the client is created with a valid connection string.

- [Breaking] The type of the `include` field of both `ServiceListQueuesOptions` and `ServiceListQueuesSegmentOptions` has changed from `ListQueuesIncludeType` to `ListQueuesIncludeType[]` due to changes in the underlying OpenAPI specification.
- [Breaking] Blob/Container member methods that manage leases are removed. A new type `LeaseClient` is added to manage leases.
- Updated dependency `@azure/ms-rest-js` to `@azure/core-http`.
- Constructor overloads added into client types so they can be constructed from a url and a pipeline/credential and connection string.
  - Constructors with overloads - `MessageIdClient`, `MessagesClient`, `QueueClient` and `QueueServiceClient`.
  - Connection string method is supported only in Node.js (not browsers).
- Creation/Deletion of child resources are duplicated to parent client type.
- HTTP proxy support is added (Node.js only).
