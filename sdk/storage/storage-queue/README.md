# Azure Storage SDK V10 for JavaScript - Queue

- [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40azure%2Fstorage-queue.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40azure%2Fstorage-queue)
- [API Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/%40azure/storage-queue/index?view=azure-node-preview)

## Introduction

This project provides a SDK in JavaScript that makes it easy to consume Microsoft Azure Storage services.

Please note that this version of the SDK is a compete overhaul of the current [Azure Storage SDK for Node.js and JavaScript in Browsers](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-node), and is based on the new Storage SDK architecture.

### Features

- Queue Storage
  - Get/Set Queue Service Properties
  - Create/List/Delete Queues
  - Enqueue/Dequeue/Peek/Clear/Update/Delete Queue Messages
- Features new
  - Asynchronous I/O for all operations using the async methods
  - HttpPipeline which enables a high degree of per-request configurability
  - 1-to-1 correlation with the Storage REST API for clarity and simplicity

### Compatibility

This SDK is compatible with Node.js and browsers, and validated against LTS Node.js versions (>=6.5) and latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

#### Compatible with IE11

You need polyfills to make this library work with IE11. The easiest way is to use [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill), or [polyfill service](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/).
Or you can load separate polyfills for missed ES feature(s).
This library depends on following ES features which need external polyfills loaded.

- `Promise`
- `String.prototype.startsWith`
- `String.prototype.endsWith`
- `String.prototype.repeat`
- `String.prototype.includes`
- `Array.prototype.includes`
- `Object.keys` (Override IE11's `Object.keys` with ES6 polyfill forcely to enable [ES6 behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys#Notes))

#### Differences between Node.js and browsers

There are differences between Node.js and browsers runtime. When getting start with this SDK, pay attention to APIs or classes marked with _"ONLY AVAILABLE IN NODE.JS RUNTIME"_ or _"ONLY AVAILABLE IN BROWSERS"_.

##### Following features, interfaces, classes or functions are only available in Node.js

- Shared Key Authorization based on account name and account key
  - `SharedKeyCredential`
- Shared Access Signature(SAS) generation
  - `generateAccountSASQueryParameters()`
  - `generateQueueSASQueryParameters()`

## Getting Started

### NPM

The preferred way to install the Azure Storage SDK for JavaScript is to use the npm package manager. Simply type the following into a terminal window:

```bash
npm install @azure/storage-queue
```

In your TypeScript or JavaScript file, import via following:

```JavaScript
import * as Azure from "@azure/storage-queue";
```

Or

```JavaScript
const Azure = require("@azure/storage-queue");
```

### JavaScript Bundle

To use the SDK with JS bundle in the browsers, simply add a script tag to your HTML pages pointing to the downloaded JS bundle file(s):

```html
<script src="https://mydomain/azure-storage-queue.min.js"></script>
```

The JS bundled file is compatible with [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) standard, if no module system found, following global variable(s) will be exported:

- `azqueue`

#### Download

Download latest released JS bundles from links in the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/releases). Or from following links directly:

- Queue [https://aka.ms/downloadazurestoragejsqueue](https://aka.ms/downloadazurestoragejsqueue)

### CORS

You need to set up [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/rest/api/storageservices/cross-origin-resource-sharing--cors--support-for-the-azure-storage-services) rules for your storage account if you need to develop for browsers. Go to Azure portal and Azure Storage Explorer, find your storage account, create new CORS rules for blob/queue/file/table service(s).

For example, you can create following CORS settings for debugging. But please customize the settings carefully according to your requirements in production environment.

- Allowed origins: \*
- Allowed verbs: DELETE,GET,HEAD,MERGE,POST,OPTIONS,PUT
- Allowed headers: \*
- Exposed headers: \*
- Maximum age (seconds): 86400

## SDK Architecture

The Azure Storage SDK for JavaScript provides low-level and high-level APIs.

* QueueServiceClient, QueueClient, MessagesClient and MessageIdClient objects provide the low-level API functionality and map one-to-one to the [Azure Storage Queue REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/queue-service-rest-api).

## Code Samples

```javascript
const {
  Aborter,
  QueueClient,
  MessagesClient,
  MessageIdClient,
  QueueServiceClient,
  StorageClient,
  SharedKeyCredential,
  AnonymousCredential,
  TokenCredential
} = require(".."); // Change to "@azure/storage-queue" in your package

async function main() {
  // Enter your storage account name and shared key
  const account = "<account>";
  const accountKey = "<accountkey>";

  // Use SharedKeyCredential with storage account and account key
  const sharedKeyCredential = new SharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);

  // Use TokenCredential with OAuth token
  const tokenCredential = new TokenCredential("token");
  tokenCredential.token = "renewedToken"; // Renew the token by updating token field of token credential

  // Use AnonymousCredential when url already includes a SAS signature
  const anonymousCredential = new AnonymousCredential();

  // Use sharedKeyCredential, tokenCredential or anonymousCredential to create a pipeline
  const pipeline = StorageClient.newPipeline(sharedKeyCredential, {
    // httpClient: MyHTTPClient, // A customized HTTP client implementing IHttpClient interface
    // logger: MyLogger, // A customized logger implementing IHttpPipelineLogger interface
    retryOptions: { maxTries: 4 }, // Retry options
    telemetry: { value: "BasicSample V10.0.0" } // Customized telemetry string
  });

  // List queues
  const blobServiceClient = new QueueServiceClient(
    // When using AnonymousCredential, following url should include a valid SAS or support public access
    `https://${account}.queue.core.windows.net`,
    pipeline
  );

  console.log(`List queues`);
  let marker;
  do {
    const listQueuesResponse = await blobServiceClient.listQueuesSegment(
      Aborter.none,
      marker
    );

    marker = listQueuesResponse.nextMarker;
    for (const queue of listQueuesResponse.queueItems) {
      console.log(`Queue: ${queue.name}`);
    }
  } while (marker);

  // Create a new queue
  const queueName = `newqueue${new Date().getTime()}`;
  const queueClient = QueueClient.fromQueueServiceClient(blobServiceClient, queueName);
  const createQueueResponse = await queueClient.create(Aborter.none);
  console.log(
    `Create queue ${queueName} successfully, service assigned request Id: ${
      createQueueResponse.requestId
    }`
  );

  // Enqueue a message into the queue using the enqueue method.
  const messagesClient = MessagesClient.fromQueueClient(queueClient);
  const enqueueQueueResponse = await messagesClient.enqueue(
    Aborter.none,
    "Hello World!"
  );
  console.log(
    `Enqueue message successfully, service assigned message Id: ${
      enqueueQueueResponse.messageId
    }, service assigned request Id: ${enqueueQueueResponse.requestId}`
  );

  // Peek a message using peek method.
  const peekQueueResponse = await messagesClient.peek(Aborter.none);
  console.log(
    `The peeked message is: ${
      peekQueueResponse.peekedMessageItems[0].messageText
    }`
  );

  // You de-queue a message in two steps. Call GetMessage at which point the message becomes invisible to any other code reading messages
  // from this queue for a default period of 30 seconds. To finish removing the message from the queue, you call DeleteMessage.
  // This two-step process ensures that if your code fails to process a message due to hardware or software failure, another instance
  // of your code can get the same message and try again.
  const dequeueResponse = await messagesClient.dequeue(Aborter.none);
  if (dequeueResponse.dequeuedMessageItems.length == 1) {
    const dequeueMessageItem = dequeueResponse.dequeuedMessageItems[0];
    console.log(
      `Processing & deleting message with content: ${
        dequeueMessageItem.messageText
      }`
    );
    const messageIdClient = MessageIdClient.fromMessagesClient(
      messagesClient,
      dequeueMessageItem.messageId
    );
    const deleteMessageResponse = await messageIdClient.delete(
      Aborter.none,
      dequeueMessageItem.popReceipt
    );
    console.log(
      `Delete message succesfully, service assigned request Id: ${
        deleteMessageResponse.requestId
      }`
    );
  }

  // Delete the queue.
  const deleteQueueResponse = await queueClient.delete(Aborter.none);
  console.log(
    `Delete queue successfully, service assigned request Id: ${
      deleteQueueResponse.requestId
    }`
  );
}

// An async method returns a Promise object, which is compatible with then().catch() coding style.
main()
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Successfully executed sample.");
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err.message);
  });
```
