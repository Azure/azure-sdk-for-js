# Breaking Changes

## 2019.11 12.0.0

- [Breaking] The custom browser and retry policies that are specific to the Storage libraries have been
  renamed to have the `Storage` prefix. [PR 5862](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/5862).
  Below are the entities that now have the Storage prefix
  - BrowserPolicy
  - BrowserPolicyFactory
  - RetryPolicy
  - RetryPolicyType
  - RetryOptions
  - RetryPolicyFactory
- [Breaking] The interface `NewPipelineOptions` has been renamed to `StoragePipelineOptions` and its
  properties have been updated as below: - The `proxy` property of type `ProxySettings | string` has been renamed to `proxyOptions` and
  will be of type `ProxyOptions`. If you have been passing url directly, split the value into `host`
  and `port` then pass it as a json object. - The `telemetry` property of type `TelemetryOptions` has been renamed to `userAgentOptions` of
  type `UserAgentOptions`. - The `logger` is no longer a property available to configure. To enable logging, please see the
  [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/0ddc2f3c3d4658b20d96910acc37a77e5209e5e3/sdk/storage/storage-queue/README.md#troubleshooting) section of our readme.
- [Breaking]
  - The `UniqueRequestIdPolicy` and `KeepAlivePolicy` are no longer exported from this library. The
    corresponding policies from the `@azure/core-http` library are meant to be used instead.
- [Breaking] The default browser bundle has been removed from the npm package. Bundling your application with a bundler such as Webpack is the recommended approach to building a browser bundle. For details on how to do this, please refer to our [bundling documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/documentation/Bundling.md).

### 2019.10 Version 12.0.0-preview.3

- `RawTokenCredential` is dropped. TokenCredential implementations can be found in the [@azure/identity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity) library for authentication.
- `Models.StorageServiceProperties` is renamed into `Models.QueueServiceProperties`.
- `Models.StorageServiceStats` is renamed into `Models.QueueServiceStatistics`.
- Replace string with boolean flag to specify dataset to include when listing queues.
  Before this change the option is specified as
  ```js
  queueServiceClient.listShares({
    include: "metadata"
  });
  ```
  After this change:
  ```js
  queueServiceClient.listShares({
    includeMetadata: true
  });
  ```

### 2019.08 Version 12.0.0-preview.2

- Aborter class is no longer exposed from the package. Use the package [@azure/abort-controller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/abort-controller) to pass an abort signal to any of the async operations.
  `AbortController.timeout(<milliseconds>)` can be utitlized as an abort signal.

### 2019.07 Version 12.0.0-preview.1

  - QueueURL, MessagesURL, MessageIdURL, ServiceURL, StorageURL to QueueClient, MessagesClient, MessageIdClient, QueueServiceClient, StorageClient respectively.
- Aborter parameters are now moved into option bags.
  - `abortSignal` attrubute(optional) in the option-bag of respective module has to be utitlized for the `Aborter.timeout(<milliseconds>)` functionality.
  - `Aborter.none` is the default value.
- I- prefixes are removed from interface names
  - Example- `IQueueCreateOptions` is updated to `QueueCreateOptions`, the new names must to be used.
