2019.01 Version 10.1.0

- [Breaking] Updated convenience layer methods enum type parameters into typescript union types, this will help reducing bundle footprint.

  - URL will accept both encoded or non-encoded URL string. It will escape non-escaped special characters, like Chinese characters. However, if directory/file name includes `%`, `url` must be encoded manually.
- [Breaking] `SASQueryParameters` is not going to be exported in browser bundle, and will be exported in Node.js runtime.
- [Breaking] IE11 needs `Array.prototype.includes` and `Object.keys` polyfills loaded.
- Updated dependency `ms-rest-js` to `@azure/ms-rest-js`.
- Fixed `Aborter.timeout()` misleading scale description.
- Removed default 60s server timeout value for retry options `tryTimeoutInMs` to avoid large blob download stream unexpected ending.
- Fixed an issue that when body is string with special characters, `FileURL.uploadRange` will fail to upload.
- Exported `HttpRequestBody` type for who wants to implement a customized HTTP client.
