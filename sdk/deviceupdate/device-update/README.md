# Azure DeviceUpdate client library for JavaScript

This package contains an isomorphic SDK (runs both in Node.js and in browsers) for Azure DeviceUpdate client.

Device Update for IoT Hub is an Azure service that enables customers to publish update for their IoT devices to the cloud, and then deploy that update to their devices (approve updates to groups of devices managed and provisioned in IoT Hub). It leverages the proven security and reliability of the Windows Update platform, optimized for IoT devices. It works globally and knows when and how to update devices, enabling customers to focus on their business goals and let Device Update for IoT Hub handle the updates.

## Getting started

### Currently supported environments

- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/about/releases/)
- Latest versions of Safari, Chrome, Edge and Firefox.

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].

### Install the `@azure/device-update` package

Install the Azure DeviceUpdate client library for JavaScript with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @azure/device-update
```

### Create and authenticate a `DeviceUpdateClient`

To create a client object to access the Azure DeviceUpdate API, you will need the `endpoint` of your Azure DeviceUpdate resource and a `credential`. The Azure DeviceUpdate client can use Azure Active Directory credentials to authenticate.
You can find the endpoint for your Azure DeviceUpdate resource in the [Azure Portal][azure_portal].

You can authenticate with Azure Active Directory using a credential from the [@azure/identity][azure_identity] library or [an existing AAD Token](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/sdk/identity/identity/samples/AzureIdentityExamples.md#authenticating-with-a-pre-fetched-access-token).

To use the [DefaultAzureCredential][defaultazurecredential] provider shown below, or other credential providers provided with the Azure SDK, please install the `@azure/identity` package:

```bash
npm install @azure/identity
```

You will also need to **register a new AAD application and grant access to Azure DeviceUpdate** by assigning the suitable role to your service principal (note: roles such as `"Owner"` will not grant the necessary permissions).
Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as environment variables: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

For more information about how to create an Azure AD Application check out [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

```javascript
const { DeviceUpdateClient } = require("@azure/device-update");
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const client = new DeviceUpdateClient("<endpoint>", new DefaultAzureCredential());
```


### JavaScript Bundle
To use this client library in the browser, first you need to use a bundler. For details on how to do this, please refer to our [bundling documentation](https://aka.ms/AzureSDKBundling).

## Key concepts

### DeviceUpdateClient

`DeviceUpdateClient` is the primary interface for developers using the Azure DeviceUpdate client library. Explore the methods on this client object to understand the different features of the Azure DeviceUpdate service that you can access.

## Troubleshooting

### Logging

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling `setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```javascript
const { setLogLevel } = require("@azure/logger");
setLogLevel("info");
```

For more detailed instructions on how to enable logs, you can look at the [@azure/logger package docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/core/logger).

## Next steps
