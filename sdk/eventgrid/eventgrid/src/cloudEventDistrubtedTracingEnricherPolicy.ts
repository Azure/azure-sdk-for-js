 * cloudEventDistributedTracingEnricherPolicy is a policy which adds distributed tracing information

 * from the HTTP request into the individual events as extension properties.
 *
 * This will only happen in the case where an event does not have a `traceparent` defined already. This
 * allows events to explicitly set a traceparent and tracestate which would be respected during "multi-hop
 * transmition".
 *
 * See https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/extensions/distributed-tracing.md
 * for more information on distributed tracing and cloud events.
