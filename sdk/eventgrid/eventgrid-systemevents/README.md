## Getting started

### Currently supported environments

- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)
- Latest versions of Safari, Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

See our [support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) for more details.

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
- An existing [Event Grid][event_grid] Topic or Domain. If you need to create the resource, you can use the [Azure Portal][azure_portal] or [Azure CLI][azure_cli].

If you use the Azure CLI, replace `<your-resource-group-name>` and `<your-resource-name>` with your own unique names:

#### Create an Event Grid Topic

```bash
az eventgrid topic create --location <location> --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-resource-name>
```

#### Create an Event Grid Domain

```bash
az eventgrid domain create --location <location> --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-resource-name>
```

### Install the `@azure/eventgrid-systemevents` package

Install the Azure Event Grid System Events client library for JavaScript with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @azure/eventgrid-systemevents
```

## Key concepts

This package provides a list of System Events that could be used to publish events to EventGrid.

## Troubleshooting

### Logging

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling `setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```ts snippet:SetLogLevel
import { setLogLevel } from "@azure/logger";

setLogLevel("info");
```

For more detailed instructions on how to enable the logs, you can look at the [@azure/logger package docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/core/logger).
