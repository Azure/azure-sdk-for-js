## Key concepts

### SystemEventsClient

`SystemEventsClient` is the primary interface for developers using the Azure SystemEvents client library. Explore the methods on this client object to understand the different features of the Azure SystemEvents service that you can access.

## Troubleshooting

### Logging

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling `setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```ts snippet:SetLogLevel
import { setLogLevel } from "@azure/logger";

setLogLevel("info");
```

For more detailed instructions on how to enable logs, you can look at the [@azure/logger package docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/core/logger).
