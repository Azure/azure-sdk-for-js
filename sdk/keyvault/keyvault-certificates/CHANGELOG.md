# Release History

## 4.1.0-preview.2 (Unreleased)


## 4.1.0-preview.1 (2020-03-10)

- Added the optional `apiVersion` property to the `CertificateClient` optional parameters.
  It defaults to the latest supported API version, which currently is `7.1-preview`.
- Added `recoverableDays` as an optional property to `KeyProperties`.
- Fixed a bug on `importCertificate`. The bytes of a PEM formatted certificate were being encoded again on base64.
  Now, if the user provides a policy with contentType `application/x-pem-file`, the bytes will be assumed to be formatted using ASCII,
  and thus will be sent as is.
