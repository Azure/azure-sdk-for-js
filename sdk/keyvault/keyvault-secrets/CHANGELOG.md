## 4.2.0 (2021-06-15)

### New Features

- Added support for the 7.2 version of the Key Vault service API.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug with `beginDeleteSecret` and `beginRecoverDeletedSecret` in which unknown service errors wouldn't bubble up properly to the end users.
- Fixed an issue where retrying a failed initial Key Vault request may result in an empty body.
- Added a `certificateKeyId?: string` secret property to use instead of the deprecated `keyId?: URL` and removed `"lib": ["dom"]` from `tsconfig.json`

### Changes since 4.2.0-beta.4:

- Fixed a bug with `beginDeleteSecret` and `beginRecoverDeletedSecret` in which unknown service errors wouldn't bubble up properly to the end users.
- Renamed the `KeyVaultSecretId` to `KeyVaultSecretIdentifier`, and exported a method to parse Key Vault Secret Ids: `parseKeyVaultSecretIdentifier`.

## 4.2.0-beta.4 (2021-04-06)

- Improved tracing across the various KeyVault libraries. By switching to a consistent naming convention, ensuring spans are always closed appropriately, and setting the correct status when an operation errors developers can expect an improved experience when enabling distributed tracing.
  - We now ensure tracing spans are properly closed with an appropriate status when an operation throws an exception.
  - If a traced operation throws an exception we will now properly record the exception message in the tracing span.
  - Finally, naming conventions have been standardized across the KeyVault libraries taking the format of `Azure.KeyVault.<PACKAGE NAME>.<CLIENT NAME>`.
- Fixed an issue where retrying a failed initial Key Vault request may result in an empty body.

## 4.2.0-beta.3 (2021-03-09)

- Updated the Latest service version to 7.2.
