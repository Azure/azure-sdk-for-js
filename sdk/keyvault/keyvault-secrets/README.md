# Azure Key Vault Secret client library for JavaScript

Azure Key Vault is a service that allows you to encrypt authentication keys, storage account keys, data encryption keys, .pfx files, and passwords by using secured keys.
If you would like to know more about Azure Key Vault, you may want to review: [What is Azure Key Vault?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-overview)

Azure Key Vault Secrets management allows you to securely store and
tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys,
and other secrets.

Use the client library for Azure Key Vault Secrets in your Node.js application to:

- Get, set and delete secrets.
- Update a secret and it's attributes.
- Backup and restore a secret.
- Get, purge or recover a deleted secret.
- Get all the versions of a secret.
- Get all secrets.
- Get all deleted secrets.

> Note: This package cannot be used in the browser due to Azure Key Vault service limitations, please refer to [this document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/samples/cors/ts/README.md) for guidance.

## Getting started

### Currently supported environments

- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/about/releases/)

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- A [Key Vault resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/quick-create-portal)

### Install the package

Install the Azure Key Vault Secret client library using npm:

`npm install @azure/keyvault-secrets`

### Install the identity library

Key Vault clients authenticate using the Azure Identity Library. Install it as well using npm

`npm install @azure/identity`

### Configure TypeScript

TypeScript users need to have Node type definitions installed:

```bash
npm install @types/node
```

You also need to enable `compilerOptions.allowSyntheticDefaultImports` in your tsconfig.json. Note that if you have enabled `compilerOptions.esModuleInterop`, `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` is enabled by default. See [TypeScript's compiler options handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) for more information.

### Configuring your Key Vault

Use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash) snippet below to create/get client secret credentials.

- Create a service principal and configure its access to Azure resources:
  ```Bash
  az ad sp create-for-rbac -n <your-application-name> --skip-assignment
  ```
  Output:
  ```json
  {
    "appId": "generated-app-ID",
    "displayName": "dummy-app-name",
    "name": "http://dummy-app-name",
    "password": "random-password",
    "tenant": "tenant-ID"
  }
  ```
- Use the above returned credentials information to set **AZURE_CLIENT_ID**(appId), **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET**(password) and **AZURE_TENANT_ID**(tenant) environment variables. The following example shows a way to do this in Bash:

  ```Bash
    export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="generated-app-ID"
    export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="random-password"
    export AZURE_TENANT_ID="tenant-ID"
  ```

- Grant the above mentioned application authorization to perform secret operations on the keyvault:

  ```Bash
  az keyvault set-policy --name <your-key-vault-name> --spn $AZURE_CLIENT_ID --secret-permissions backup delete get list purge recover restore set
  ```

  > --secret-permissions:
  > Accepted values: backup, delete, get, list, purge, recover, restore, set

  If you have enabled role-based access control (RBAC) for Key Vault instead, you can find roles like "Key Vault Secrets Officer" in our [RBAC guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide).

- Use the above mentioned Key Vault name to retrieve details of your Vault which also contains your Key Vault URL:
  ```Bash
  az keyvault show --name <your-key-vault-name>
  ```

## Key concepts

- The **Secret client** is the primary interface to interact with the API methods
  related to secrets in the Azure Key Vault API from a JavaScript application.
  Once initialized, it provides a basic set of methods that can be used to
  create, read, update and delete secrets.
- A **Secret version** is a version of a secret in the Key Vault.
  Each time a user assigns a value to a unique secret name, a new **version**
  of that secret is created. Retrieving a secret by a name will always return
  the latest value assigned, unless a specific version is provided to the
  query.
- **Soft delete** allows Key Vaults to support deletion and purging as two
  separate steps, so deleted secrets are not immediately lost. This only happens if the Key Vault
  has [soft-delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-soft-delete)
  enabled.
- A **Secret backup** can be generated from any created secret. These backups come as
  binary data, and can only be used to regenerate a previously deleted secret.

## Authenticating with Azure Active Directory

The Key Vault service relies on Azure Active Directory to authenticate requests to its APIs. The [`@azure/identity`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity) package provides a variety of credential types that your application can use to do this. The [README for `@azure/identity`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/identity/identity/README.md) provides more details and samples to get you started.

Here's a quick example. First, import `DefaultAzureCredential` and `SecretClient`:

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");
```

Once these are imported, we can next connect to the Key Vault service. To do this, we'll need to copy some settings from the Key Vault we are connecting to into our environment variables. Once they are in our environment, we can access them with the following code:

```typescript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");

// DefaultAzureCredential expects the following three environment variables:
// * AZURE_TENANT_ID: The tenant ID in Azure Active Directory
// * AZURE_CLIENT_ID: The application (client) ID registered in the AAD tenant
// * AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: The client secret for the registered application
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

// Build the URL to reach your key vault
const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

// Lastly, create our secrets client and connect to the service
const client = new SecretClient(url, credential);
```

## Specifying the Azure Key Vault service API version

By default, this package uses the latest Azure Key Vault service version which is `7.1`. The only other version that is supported is `7.0`. You can change the service version being used by setting the option `serviceVersion` in the client constructor as shown below:

```typescript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

// Change the Azure Key Vault service API version being used via the `serviceVersion` option
const client = new SecretClient(url, credential, {
  serviceVersion: "7.0",
});
```

## Examples

The following sections provide code snippets that cover some of the common
tasks using Azure Key Vault Secrets. The scenarios that are covered here consist of:

- [Creating and setting a secret](#creating-and-setting-a-secret).
- [Getting a secret](#getting-a-secret).
- [Creating and updating secrets with attributes](#creating-and-updating-secrets-with-attributes).
- [Deleting a secret](#deleting-a-secret).
- [Iterating lists of secrets](#iterating-lists-of-secrets).

### Creating and setting a secret

`setSecret` assigns a provided value to the specified secret name. If a secret
with the same name already exists, then a new version of the secret is created.

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new SecretClient(url, credential);

const secretName = "MySecretName";

async function main() {
  const result = await client.setSecret(secretName, "MySecretValue");
  console.log("result: ", result);
}

main();
```

### Getting a secret

The simplest way to read secrets back from the vault is to get a secret by
name. This will retrieve the most recent version of the secret. You can
optionally get a different version of the key if you specify it as part of the
optional parameters.

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new SecretClient(url, credential);

const secretName = "MySecretName";

async function main() {
  const latestSecret = await client.getSecret(secretName);
  console.log(`Latest version of the secret ${secretName}: `, latestSecret);
  const specificSecret = await client.getSecret(secretName, { version: latestSecret.properties.version! });
  console.log(`The secret ${secretName} at the version ${latestSecret.properties.version!}: `, specificSecret);
}

main();
```

### Creating and updating secrets with attributes

A secret can have more information than its name and its value. They can also include
the following attributes:

- `tags`: Any set of key-values that can be used to search and filter secrets.
- `contentType`: Any string that can be used to help the receiver of the secret understand how to use the secret value.
- `enabled`: A boolean value that determines whether the secret value can be read or not.
- `notBefore`: A given date after which the secret value can be retrieved.
- `expires`: A given date after which the secret value cannot be retrieved.

An object with these attributes can be sent as the third parameter of
`setSecret`, right after the secret's name and value, as follows:

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new SecretClient(url, credential);

const secretName = "MySecretName";

async function main() {
  const result = await client.setSecret(secretName, "MySecretValue", {
    enabled: false,
  });
}

main();
```

This will create a new version of the same secret, which will have the latest
provided attributes.

Attributes can also be updated to an existing secret version with
`updateSecretProperties`, as follows:

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new SecretClient(url, credential);

const secretName = "MySecretName";

async function main() {
  const result = await client.getSecret(secretName);
  await client.updateSecretProperties(secretName, result.properties.version, { enabled: false });
}

main();
```

### Deleting a secret

The `beginDeleteSecret` method starts the deletion of a Secret.
This process will happen in the background as soon as the necessary resources
are available.

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new SecretClient(url, credential);

const secretName = "MySecretName";

async function main() {
  await client.beginDeleteSecret(secretName);
}

main();
```

If [soft-delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-soft-delete)
is enabled for the Key Vault, this operation will only label the secret as a
_deleted_ secret. A deleted secret can't be updated. They can only be either
read, recovered or purged.

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new SecretClient(url, credential);

const secretName = "MySecretName";

async function main() {
  const poller = await client.beginDeleteSecret(secretName);

  // You can use the deleted secret immediately:
  const deletedSecret = poller.getResult();

  // The secret is being deleted. Only wait for it if you want to restore it or purge it.
  await poller.pollUntilDone();

  // You can also get the deleted secret this way:
  await client.getDeletedSecret(secretName);

  // Deleted secrets can also be recovered or purged.

  // recoverDeletedSecret returns a poller, just like beginDeleteSecret.
  const recoverPoller = await client.beginRecoverDeletedSecret(secretName);
  await recoverPoller.pollUntilDone();

  // And then, to purge the deleted secret:
  await client.purgeDeletedSecret(secretName);
}

main();
```

Since Secrets take some time to get fully deleted, `beginDeleteSecret`
returns a Poller object that keeps track of the underlying Long Running
Operation according to our guidelines:
https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/typescript_design.html#ts-lro

The received poller will allow you to get the deleted secret by calling to `poller.getResult()`.
You can also wait until the deletion finishes, either by running individual service
calls until the secret is deleted, or by waiting until the process is done:

```typescript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new SecretClient(url, credential);

const secretName = "MySecretName";

async function main() {
  const poller = await client.beginDeleteSecret(secretName);

  // You can use the deleted secret immediately:
  let deletedSecret = poller.getResult();

  // Or you can wait until the secret finishes being deleted:
  deletedSecret = await poller.pollUntilDone();
  console.log(deletedSecret);
}

main();
```

Another way to wait until the secret is fully deleted is to do individual calls, as follows:

```typescript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");
const { delay } = require("@azure/core-http");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new SecretClient(url, credential);

const secretName = "MySecretName";

async function main() {
  const poller = await client.beginDeleteSecret(secretName);

  while (!poller.isDone()) {
    await poller.poll();
    await delay(5000);
  }

  console.log(`The secret ${secretName} is fully deleted`);
}

main();
```

### Iterating lists of secrets

Using the SecretClient, you can retrieve and iterate through all of the
secrets in a Key Vault, as well as through all of the deleted secrets and the
versions of a specific secret. The following API methods are available:

- `listPropertiesOfSecrets` will list all of your non-deleted secrets by their names, only
  at their latest versions.
- `listDeletedSecrets` will list all of your deleted secrets by their names,
  only at their latest versions.
- `listPropertiesOfSecretVersions` will list all the versions of a secret based on a secret
  name.

Which can be used as follows:

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new SecretClient(url, credential);

const secretName = "MySecretName";

async function main() {
  for await (let secretProperties of client.listPropertiesOfSecrets()) {
    console.log("Secret properties: ", secretProperties);
  }
  for await (let deletedSecret of client.listDeletedSecrets()) {
    console.log("Deleted secret: ", deletedSecret);
  }
  for await (let versionProperties of client.listPropertiesOfSecretVersions(secretName)) {
    console.log("Version properties: ", versionProperties);
  }
}

main();
```

All of these methods will return **all of the available results** at once. To
retrieve them by pages, add `.byPage()` right after invoking the API method you
want to use, as follows:

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { SecretClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-secrets");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new SecretClient(url, credential);

const secretName = "MySecretName";

async function main() {
  for await (let page of client.listPropertiesOfSecrets().byPage()) {
    for (let secretProperties of page) {
      console.log("Secret properties: ", secretProperties);
    }
  }
  for await (let page of client.listDeletedSecrets().byPage()) {
    for (let deletedSecret of page) {
      console.log("Deleted secret: ", deletedSecret);
    }
  }
  for await (let page of client.listPropertiesOfSecretVersions(secretName).byPage()) {
    for (let versionProperties of page) {
      console.log("Version properties: ", versionProperties);
    }
  }
}

main();
```

## Troubleshooting

See our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/keyvault/keyvault-secrets/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for details on how to diagnose various failure scenarios.

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling `setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```javascript
import { setLogLevel } from "@azure/logger";

setLogLevel("info");
```
