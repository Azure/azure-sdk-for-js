## 4.0.0-beta.3 (2021-04-06)

- Updated the Latest service version to 7.2.
- Long Running Operations will now use the `status` field to determine whether the operation failed.
- Improved tracing across the various KeyVault libraries. By switching to a consistent naming convention, ensuring spans are always closed appropriately, and setting the correct status when an operation errors developers can expect an improved experience when enabling distributed tracing.
  - We now ensure tracing spans are properly closed with an appropriate status when an operation throws an exception.
  - If a traced operation throws an exception we will now properly record the exception message in the tracing span.
  - Finally, naming conventions have been standardized across the KeyVault libraries taking the format of `Azure.KeyVault.<PACKAGE NAME>.<CLIENT NAME>`.
- Fixed an issue where retrying a failed initial Key Vault request may result in an empty body.

## 4.0.0-beta.2 (2021-02-09)

- Updated the Key Vault Admin Long Running Operation Pollers to follow a more compact and meaningful approach moving forward.
- Bug fix: The logging of HTTP requests wasn't properly working - now it has been fixed and tests have been written that verify the fix.
- [Breaking] Return `BackupResult` and `RestoreResult` from backup/restore long running operations which will contain additional information about the operation as well any relevant data.
- Backup / Restore polling will now correctly propagate any errors to the awaited call.

## 4.0.0-beta.1 (2020-09-11)

The @azure/keyvault-admin package provides two clients, `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` and `KeyVaultBackupClient`.

- The `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` allows working with role-based access control (RBAC) operations, meaning assigning, deleting and retrieving role assignments, and retrieving role definitions.
- The `KeyVaultBackupClient` allows generating full backups and restores of Key Vault instances, and selective restores of keys.
