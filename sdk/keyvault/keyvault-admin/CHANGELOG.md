## 4.0.0-beta.1 (2020-09-11)

The @azure/keyvault-admin package provides two clients, `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` and `KeyVaultBackupClient`.

- The `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` allows working with role-based access control (RBAC) operations, meaning assigning, deleting and retrieving role assignments, and retrieving role definitions.
- The `KeyVaultBackupClient` allows generating full backups and restores of Key Vault instances, and selective restores of keys.
