### Hide LROs

```yaml
directive:
  - from: swagger-document
    where: $["paths"]
    transform: >
      for (var path in $) {
          for (var op of Object.values($[path])) {
              if (op["x-ms-long-running-operation"]) {
                  delete op["x-ms-long-running-operation"];
              }
          }
      }
```

### Ignore 404s for DELETE operations

Treat HTTP 404 responses for DELETE operations for RBAC as non-errors.

```yaml
directive:
  - where-operation: RoleAssignments_Delete
    transform: >
      $.responses["404"] = {
          "description": "The resource to delete does not exist.",
          "x-ms-error-response": false
      };
  - where-operation: RoleDefinitions_Delete
    transform: >
      $.responses["404"] = {
          "description": "The resource to delete does not exist.",
          "x-ms-error-response": false
      };
```

### Return void for DELETE operations

Do not parse response bodies unnecessarily.

```yaml
directive:
  - where-operation: RoleAssignments_Delete
    transform: >
      delete $.responses["200"].schema;
  - where-operation: RoleDefinitions_Delete
    transform: >
      delete $.responses["200"].schema;
```
