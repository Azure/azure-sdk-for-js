# Azure Key Vault Key client library for JavaScript

Azure Key Vault is a service that allows you to encrypt authentication keys, storage account keys, data encryption keys, .pfx files, and passwords by using secured keys.
If you would like to know more about Azure Key Vault, you may want to review: [What is Azure Key Vault?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-overview)

Azure Key Vault Key management allows you to create and control 
encryption keys that encrypt your data.

Use the client library for Azure Key Vault Keys in your Node.js application to:

- Create keys using elliptic curve or RSA encryption, optionally backed by Hardware Security Modules (HSM).
- Import, Delete, and Update keys.
- Get one or more keys and deleted keys, with their attributes.
- Recover a deleted key and restore a backed up key.
- Get the versions of a key.

Using the cryptography client available in this library you also have access to:

- Encrypting
- Decrypting
- Signing
- Verifying
- Wrapping keys
- Unwrapping keys

> Note: This package cannot be used in the browser due to Azure Key Vault service limitations.

[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/keyvault/keyvault-keys) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/keyvault-keys) | [API Reference Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/keyvault-keys) | [Product documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/) | [Samples](./samples)

## Getting started

**Prerequisites**: You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and a
[Key Vault resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/quick-create-portal) to use this package.

If you are using this package in a Node.js application, then use Node.js 8.x or higher.

### Install the package

Install the Azure Key Vault Key client library using npm

`npm install @azure/keyvault-keys`

### Install the identity library

Key Vault clients authenticate using the Azure identity library. Install it as well using npm

`npm install @azure/identity`

### Configure TypeScript

TypeScript users need to have Node type definitions installed:

```bash
npm install @types/node
```

You also need to enable `compilerOptions.allowSyntheticDefaultImports` in your tsconfig.json. Note that if you have enabled `compilerOptions.esModuleInterop`, `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` is enabled by default. See [TypeScript's compiler options handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) for more information.

### Configuring your Key Vault

Use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash) snippet below to create/get client secret credentials.

- Create a service principal and configure its access to Azure resources:
  ```Bash
  az ad sp create-for-rbac -n <your-application-name> --skip-assignment
  ```
  Output:
  ```json
  {
    "appId": "generated-app-ID",
    "displayName": "dummy-app-name",
    "name": "http://dummy-app-name",
    "password": "random-password",
    "tenant": "tenant-ID"
  }
  ```
- Use the above returned credentials information to set **AZURE_CLIENT_ID**(appId), **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET**(password) and **AZURE_TENANT_ID**(tenant) environment variables. The following example shows a way to do this in Bash:

  ```Bash
    export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="generated-app-ID"
    export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="random-password"
    export AZURE_TENANT_ID="tenant-ID"
  ```

- Grant the above mentioned application authorization to perform key operations on the keyvault:

  ```Bash
  az keyvault set-policy --name <your-key-vault-name> --spn $AZURE_CLIENT_ID --key-permissions backup create decrypt delete encrypt get import list purge recover restore sign unwrapKey update verify wrapKey
  ```

  > --secret-permissions:
  > Accepted values: backup, create, decrypt, delete, encrypt, get, import, list, purge, recover, restore, sign, unwrapKey, update, verify, wrapKey

- Use the above mentioned Key Vault name to retrieve details of your Vault which also contains your Key Vault URL:
  ```Bash
  az keyvault show --name <your-key-vault-name>
  ```

## Key concepts

- The **Key client** is the primary interface to interact with the API methods
  related to keys in the Azure Key Vault API from a JavaScript application.
  Once initialized, it provides a basic set of methods that can be used to
  create, read, update and delete keys.
- A **Key version** is a version of a key in the Key Vault.
  Each time a user assigns a value to a unique key name, a new **version**
  of that key is created. Retrieving a key by a name will always return
  the latest value assigned, unless a specific version is provided to the
  query.
- **Soft delete** allows Key Vaults to support deletion and purging as two
  separate steps, so deleted keys are not immediately lost. This only happens if the Key Vault
  has [soft-delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-soft-delete)
  enabled.
- A **Key backup** can be generated from any created key. These backups come as
  binary data, and can only be used to regenerate a previously deleted key.
- The **Cryptography client** is a separate interface that interacts with the
  keys API methods in the Key Vault API. This client focuses only in the
  cryptography operations that can be executed using a key that has been
  already created in the Key Vault. More about this client in the
  [Cryptography](#cryptography) section.

## Authenticating with Azure Active Directory

The Key Vault service relies on Azure Active Directory to authenticate requests to its APIs. The [`@azure/identity`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity) package provides a variety of credential types that your application can use to do this. The [README for `@azure/identity`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/identity/identity/README.md) provides more details and samples to get you started.

Here's a quick example. First, import `DefaultAzureCredential` and `KeyClient`:

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { KeyClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-keys");
```

Once these are imported, we can next connect to the Key Vault service. To do this, we'll need to copy some settings from the key vault we are connecting to into our environment variables. Once they are in our environment, we can access them with the following code:

```typescript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { KeyClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-keys");

// DefaultAzureCredential expects the following three environment variables:
// * AZURE_TENANT_ID: The tenant ID in Azure Active Directory
// * AZURE_CLIENT_ID: The application (client) ID registered in the AAD tenant
// * AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: The client secret for the registered application
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

// Build the URL to reach your key vault
const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

// Lastly, create our keys client and connect to the service
const client = new KeyClient(url, credential);
```

## Specifying the Azure Key Vault service API version

By default, this package uses the latest Azure Key Vault service version which is `7.1`. The only other version that is supported is `7.0`. You can change the service version being used by setting the option `serviceVersion` in the client constructor as shown below:

```typescript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { KeyClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-keys");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

// Change the Azure Key Vault service API version being used via the `serviceVersion` option
const client = new KeyClient(url, credential, {
  serviceVersion: "7.0"
});
```

## Examples

The following sections provide code snippets that cover some of the common
tasks using Azure Key Vault Keys. The scenarios that are covered here consist of:

- [Creating a key](#creating-a-key).
- [Getting a key](#getting-a-key).
- [Creating and updating keys with attributes](#creating-and-updating-keys-with-attributes).
- [Deleting a key](#deleting-a-key).
- [Iterating lists of keys](#iterating-lists-of-keys).

### Creating a key

`createKey` creates a Key to be stored in the Azure Key Vault. If a key with
the same name already exists, then a new version of the key is created.

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { KeyClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-keys");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new KeyClient(url, credential);

const keyName = "MyKeyName";

async function main() {
  const result = await client.createKey(keyName, "RSA");
  console.log("result: ", result);
}

main();
```

The second parameter sent to `createKey` is the type of the key. Keys can
either be of either one of the following types:

- `EC` for a key generated using Elliptic Curve cryptography.
- `EC-HSM` for a key generated with Elliptic Curve cryptography with Hardware Security Modules.
- `RSA` for Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman cryptography.
- `RSA-HSM` for Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman cryptography with Hardware Security Modules.

### Getting a key

The simplest way to read keys back from the vault is to get a key by name. This
will retrieve the most recent version of the key. You can optionally get a
different version of the key if you specify it as part of the optional
parameters.

`getKey` retrieves a key previous stores in the Key Vault.

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { KeyClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-keys");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new KeyClient(url, credential);

const keyName = "MyKeyName";

async function main() {
  const latestKey = await client.getKey(keyName);
  console.log(`Latest version of the key ${keyName}: `, latestKey);
  const specificKey = await client.getKey(keyName, { version: latestKey.properties.version! });
  console.log(`The key ${keyName} at the version ${latestKey.properties.version!}: `, specificKey);
}

main();
```

### Creating and updating keys with attributes

The following attributes can also be assigned to any key in a Key Vault:

- `tags`: Any set of key-values that can be used to search and filter keys.
- `keyOps`: An array of the operations that this key will be able to perform (`encrypt`, `decrypt`, `sign`, `verify`, `wrapKey`, `unwrapKey`).
- `enabled`: A boolean value that determines whether the key value can be read or not.
- `notBefore`: A given date after which the key value can be retrieved.
- `expires`: A given date after which the key value cannot be retrieved.

An object with these attributes can be sent as the third parameter of
`createKey`, right after the key's name and value, as follows:

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { KeyClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-keys");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new KeyClient(url, credential);

const keyName = "MyKeyName";

async function main() {
  const result = await client.createKey(keyName, "RSA", {
    enabled: false
  });
  console.log("result: ", result);
}

main();
```

This will create a new version of the same key, which will have the latest
provided attributes.

Attributes can also be updated to an existing key version with
`updateKeyProperties`, as follows:

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { KeyClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-keys");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new KeyClient(url, credential);

const keyName = "MyKeyName";

async function main() {
  const result = await client.createKey(keyName, "RSA");
  await client.updateKeyProperties(keyName, result.properties.version, {
    enabled: false
  });
}

main();
```

### Deleting a key

The `beginDeleteKey` method starts the deletion of a key.
This process will happen in the background as soon as the necessary resources
are available.

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { KeyClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-keys");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new KeyClient(url, credential);

const keyName = "MyKeyName";

async function main() {
  const poller = await client.beginDeleteKey(keyName);
  await poller.pollUntilDone();
}

main();
```

If [soft-delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-soft-delete)
is enabled for the Key Vault, this operation will only label the key as a
_deleted_ key. A deleted key can't be updated. They can only be either
read, recovered or purged.

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { KeyClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-keys");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new KeyClient(url, credential);

const keyName = "MyKeyName";

async function main() {
  const poller = await client.beginDeleteKey(keyName)

  // You can use the deleted key immediately:
  const deletedKey = poller.getResult();

  // The key is being deleted. Only wait for it if you want to restore it or purge it.
  await poller.pollUntilDone();

  // You can also get the deleted key this way:
  await client.getDeletedKey(keyName);

  // Deleted keys can also be recovered or purged:

  // recoverDeletedKey also returns a poller, just like beginDeleteKey.
  const recoverPoller = await client.beginRecoverDeletedKey(keyName)
  await recoverPoller.pollUntilDone();

  // And here is how to purge a deleted key
  await client.purgeDeletedKey(keyName);
}

main();
```

Since Keys take some time to get fully deleted, `beginDeleteKey`
returns a Poller object that keeps track of the underlying Long Running
Operation according to our guidelines:
https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/typescript_design.html#ts-lro

The received poller will allow you to get the deleted key by calling to `poller.getResult()`.
You can also wait until the deletion finishes, either by running individual service
calls until the key is deleted, or by waiting until the process is done:

```typescript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { KeyClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-keys");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new KeyClient(url, credential);

const keyName = "MyKeyName";

async function main() {
  const poller = await client.beginDeleteKey(keyName);

  // You can use the deleted key immediately:
  let deletedKey = poller.getResult();

  // Or you can wait until the key finishes being deleted:
  deletedKey = await poller.pollUntilDone();
  console.log(deletedKey);
}

main();
```

Another way to wait until the key is fully deleted is to do individual calls, as follows:

```typescript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { KeyClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-keys");
const { delay } = require("@azure/core-http");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new KeyClient(url, credential);

const keyName = "MyKeyName";

async function main() {
  const poller = await client.beginDeleteKey(keyName);

  while (!poller.isDone()) {
    await poller.poll();
    await delay(5000);
  }

  console.log(`The key ${keyName} is fully deleted`);
}

main();
```

### Iterating lists of keys

Using the KeyClient, you can retrieve and iterate through all of the
keys in a Key Vault, as well as through all of the deleted keys and the
versions of a specific key. The following API methods are available:

- `listPropertiesOfKeys` will list all of your non-deleted keys by their names, only
  at their latest versions.
- `listDeletedKeys` will list all of your deleted keys by their names,
  only at their latest versions.
- `listPropertiesOfKeyVersions` will list all the versions of a key based on a key
  name.

Which can be used as follows:

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { KeyClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-keys");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new KeyClient(url, credential);

const keyName = "MyKeyName";

async function main() {
  for await (let keyProperties of client.listPropertiesOfKeys()) {
    console.log("Key properties: ", keyProperties);
  }
  for await (let deletedKey of client.listDeletedKeys()) {
    console.log("Deleted: ", deletedKey);
  }
  for await (let versionProperties of client.listPropertiesOfKeyVersions(keyName)) {
    console.log("Version properties: ", versionProperties);
  }
}

main();
```

All of these methods will return **all of the available results** at once. To
retrieve them by pages, add `.byPage()` right after invoking the API method you
want to use, as follows:

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { KeyClient } = require("@azure/keyvault-keys");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const client = new KeyClient(url, credential);

const keyName = "MyKeyName";

async function main() {
  for await (let page of client.listPropertiesOfKeys().byPage()) {
    for (let keyProperties of page) {
      console.log("Key properties: ", keyProperties);
    }
  }
  for await (let page of client.listDeletedKeys().byPage()) {
    for (let deletedKey of page) {
      console.log("Deleted key: ", deletedKey);
    }
  }
  for await (let page of client.listPropertiesOfKeyVersions(keyName).byPage()) {
    for (let versionProperties of page) {
      console.log("Version: ", versionProperties);
    }
  }
}
```

## Cryptography

This library also offers a set of cryptographic utilities available through
`CryptographyClient`. Similar to the `KeyClient`, `CryptographyClient` will
connect to Azure Key Vault with the provided set of credentials. Once
connected, `CryptographyClient` can encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify, wrap keys,
and unwrap keys.

We can next connect to the key vault service just as we do with the KeyClient.
We'll need to copy some settings from the key vault we are
connecting to into our environment variables. Once they are in our environment,
we can access them with the following code:

```typescript
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";
import { KeyClient, CryptographyClient } from "@azure/keyvault-keys";

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const keysClient = new KeyClient(url, credential);

async function main() {
  // Create or retrieve a key from the keyvault
  let myKey = await keysClient.createKey("MyKey", "RSA");

// Lastly, create our cryptography client and connect to the service
// This example uses the URL that is part of the key we created (called key ID)
const cryptographyClient = new CryptographyClient(myKey.id, credential);
```

### Encrypt

`encrypt` will encrypt a message. The following algorithms are currently supported: "RSA-OAEP", "RSA-OAEP-256", and "RSA1_5".

```javascript
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";
import { KeyClient, CryptographyClient } from "@azure/keyvault-keys";

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const keysClient = new KeyClient(url, credential);

async function main() {
  let myKey = await keysClient.createKey("MyKey", "RSA");
  const cryptographyClient = new CryptographyClient(myKey.id, credential);

  const encryptResult = await cryptographyClient.encrypt("RSA1_5", Buffer.from("My Message"));
  console.log("encrypt result: ", encryptResult.result);
}

main();
```

### Decrypt

`decrypt` will decrypt an encrypted message. The following algorithms are currently supported: "RSA-OAEP", "RSA-OAEP-256", and "RSA1_5".

```javascript
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";
import { KeyClient, CryptographyClient } from "@azure/keyvault-keys";

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const keysClient = new KeyClient(url, credential);

async function main() {
  let myKey = await keysClient.createKey("MyKey", "RSA");
  const cryptographyClient = new CryptographyClient(myKey.id, credential);

  const encryptResult = await cryptographyClient.encrypt("RSA1_5", Buffer.from("My Message"));
  console.log("encrypt result: ", encryptResult.result);

  const decryptResult = await cryptographyClient.decrypt("RSA1_5", encryptResult.result);
  console.log("decrypt result: ", decryptResult.result.toString());
}

main();
```

### Sign

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const keysClient = new KeyClient(url, credential);

async function main() {
  let myKey = await keysClient.createKey("MyKey", "RSA");
  const cryptographyClient = new CryptographyClient(myKey.id, credential);

  const signatureValue = "MySignature";
  let hash = crypto.createHash("sha256");

  let digest = hash.update(signatureValue).digest();
  console.log("digest: ", digest);

```

### Wrap Key

`wrapKey` will wrap a key with an encryption layer. The following algorithms are currently supported: "RSA-OAEP", "RSA-OAEP-256", and "RSA1_5".

```javascript
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";
import { KeyClient, CryptographyClient } from "@azure/keyvault-keys";

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const keysClient = new KeyClient(url, credential);

async function main() {
  let myKey = await keysClient.createKey("MyKey", "RSA");
  const cryptographyClient = new CryptographyClient(myKey.id, credential);

  const wrapResult = await cryptographyClient.wrapKey("RSA-OAEP", Buffer.from("My Key"));
  console.log("wrap result:", wrapResult.result);
}

```

### Unwrap Key

`unwrapKey` will unwrap a wrapped key. The following algorithms are currently supported: "RSA-OAEP", "RSA-OAEP-256", and "RSA1_5".

```javascript
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";
import { KeyClient, CryptographyClient } from "@azure/keyvault-keys";

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

const vaultName = "<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>";
const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;

const keysClient = new KeyClient(url, credential);

async function main() {
  let myKey = await keysClient.createKey("MyKey", "RSA");
  const cryptographyClient = new CryptographyClient(myKey.id, credential);

  const wrapResult = await cryptographyClient.wrapKey("RSA-OAEP", Buffer.from("My Key"));
  console.log("wrap result:", wrapResult.result);

  const unwrapResult = await cryptographyClient.unwrapKey("RSA-OAEP", wrapResult.result);
  console.log("unwrap result: ", unwrapResult.result);
}

main();
```

## Troubleshooting

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling `setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```javascript
import { setLogLevel } from "@azure/logger";

setLogLevel("info");
```
