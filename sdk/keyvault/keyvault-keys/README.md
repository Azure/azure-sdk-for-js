# Azure KeyVault client library for JS - Keys

Azure KeyVault is a service that allows you to encrypt authentication
keys, storage account keys, data encryption keys, .pfx files, and
passwords by using keys that are protected by hardware security
modules (HSMs).

Azure KeyVault Key management allows you to creatge and control
encryption keys that encrypt your data.

Use the client library for Azure KeyVault Keys in your Node.js application to

- Create keys (EC, EC-HSM, RSA, RSA-HSM).
- Import keys.
- Delete keys.
- Update keys.
- Get one or more keys.
- Get one or more deleted keys.
- Recover a deleted key.
- Restore a backed up key.
- Get the versions of a key.
- As well as obtaining the attributes of a key.

[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/keyvault/keyvault-keys) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/keyvault-keys) | [API Reference Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/%40azure/keyvault/) | [Product documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/keyvault/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/keyvault/keyvault-services/samples)

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Event KeyVault Keys client library using npm

`npm install @azure/keyvault-keys`

**Prerequisites**: You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and a
[KeyVault resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/quick-create-portal) to use this package.
If you are using this package in a Node.js application, then use Node.js 6.x or higher.

### Configure Typescript

TypeScript users need to have Node type definitions installed:

```bash
npm install @types/node
```

You also need to enable `compilerOptions.allowSyntheticDefaultImports` in your tsconfig.json. Note that if you have enabled `compilerOptions.esModuleInterop`, `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` is enabled by default. See [TypeScript's compiler options handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) for more information.

### Authenticate the client

Here's an example authentication:

```typescript
import { KeysClient } from "@azure/keyvault-keys";
import * as msRestNodeAuth from "@azure/ms-rest-nodeauth";

const clientId = process.env["CLIENT_ID"] || "";
const clientSecret = process.env["CLIENT_SECRET"] || "";
const tenantId = process.env["TENANT_ID"] || "";
const vaultName = process.env["KEYVAULT_NAME"] || "<keyvault-name>"

const url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;
const credential = await msRestNodeAuth.loginWithServicePrincipalSecret(
  clientId,
  clientSecret,
  tenantId,
  {
    tokenAudience: 'https://vault.azure.net'
  }
);

const client = new KeysClient(url, credential);
```

## Examples

The following sections provide code snippets that cover some of the
common tasks using Azure KeyVault Keys

- [Single key](#single-key)

### Single key

Once you have created an instance of an `KeysClient` class, you can:

```javascript
const secretName = "MyKeyName";
const result = await client.createKey("MyKeyName", "RSA");

console.log("result: ", result);

for await (let x of client.getKeyVersions("MyKeyName")) {
  console.log(">> ", x);
}

const getResult = await client.getKey("MyKeyName");
console.log("getResult: ", getResult);
let encoded = Buffer.from("Hello World");

for await (let x of client.getAllKeys()) {
  console.log(">> ", x);
}

await client.deleteKey(secretName);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Enable logs

You can set the following environment variable to get the debug logs when using this library.

- Getting debug logs from the KeyVault Keys SDK

```bash
export DEBUG=azure*
```

- Getting debug logs from the KeyVault Keys SDK and the protocol level library.

```bash
export DEBUG=azure*,rhea*
```

- If you are **not interested in viewing the event transformation** (which consumes lot of console/disk space) then you can set the `DEBUG` environment variable as follows:

```bash
export DEBUG=azure*,rhea*,-rhea:raw,-rhea:message,-azure:amqp-common:datatransformer
```

- If you are interested only in **errors**, then you can set the `DEBUG` environment variable as follows:

```bash
export DEBUG=azure:keyvault-keys:error,azure-amqp-common:error,rhea-promise:error,rhea:events,rhea:frames,rhea:io,rhea:flow
```

### Logging to a file

- Set the `DEBUG` environment variable as shown above and then run your test script as follows:
  - Logging statements from your test script go to `out.log` and logging statements from the sdk go to `debug.log`.
    ```bash
    node your-test-script.js > out.log 2>debug.log
    ```
  - Logging statements from your test script and the sdk go to the same file `out.log` by redirecting stderr to stdout (&1), and then redirect stdout to a file:
    ```bash
    node your-test-script.js >out.log 2>&1
    ```
  - Logging statements from your test script and the sdk go to the same file `out.log`.
    ```bash
      node your-test-script.js &> out.log
    ```
