# Testing

## Overview

To test this project, make sure to build it by following our [building instructions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building), then follow the [testing instructions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing).

You can use existing Azure resources for the live tests, or generate new ones by using our [New-TestResources.ps1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/eng/common/TestResources/New-TestResources.ps1) script, which will use an [ARM template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/keyvault/test-resources.json) that already has all of the the necessary configurations.

## Managed HSM tests

Some tests require an Azure Managed HSM to run in live mode, which will need to be deployed and activated. To do so you'll want to pass `enableHsm` as an ARM template parameter.

As an example:

```powershell
New-TestResources.ps1 -ServiceDirectory 'keyvault' -ArmTemplateParameters @{ "enableHsm" = $true }
```

The `New-TestResources` script will ensure that the Managed HSM is activated; however, if you are creating your own Managed HSM there are additional steps required to set up the correct permissions and activate the HSM. Please see [Activate Your Managed HSM](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/keyvault/keyvault-admin/README.md#activate-your-managed-hsm) for more information.

> Managed HSMs do have an hourly cost even when not in-use. Please review the [Azure Dedicated HSM Pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-dedicated-hsm/#pricing) and clean up the resources when not in use.

Tests that require a managed HSM will be skipped if the `AZURE_MANAGEDHSM_URI` environment variable is not defined in live mode.

The Azure resource that is used by the tests in this project is:

- An [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts). Your Azure Active Directory application needs to be added to the Access Policies of the Key Vault. The steps are provided [below](#aad-based-authentication).
- An [Azure Key Vault Managed HSM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts). Your Azure Active Directory application needs to be added to the Access Policies of the Key Vault. The steps are provided [below](#aad-based-authentication).
- An [Azure Web App for Containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/tutorial-custom-container?pivots=container-linux) is used to deploy a mock attestation service that is used to generate tokens and verify tokens by the HSM. The source code for the attestation service is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/tree/main/tools/keyvault-mock-attestation) and is deployed by the same ARM template.

To run the live tests, you will also need to set the below environment variables:

- `TEST_MODE`: Should have `live` assigned.
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID of an Azure Active Directory application.
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret of an Azure Active Directory application.
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: The Tenant ID of your organization in Azure Active Directory.
- `KEYVAULT_URI`: The URI of the KeyVault to use.
- `AZURE_KEYVAULT_ATTESTATION_URI`: The URI of the mock attestation service used for Secure Key Release tests.

In addition, when running HSM based live tests the following environment variables are required:

> If `AZURE_MANAGEDHSM_URI` is not defined, these tests will be skipped in live mode.

- `AZURE_MANAGEDHSM_URI`: The URI of the Azure Managed HSM to use in the Managed HSM tests.

The live tests in this project will create, modify and delete [keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/keys/about-keys) inside of the provided Azure Key Vault.

## AAD based authentication

The following steps will help you setup the AAD credentials.

### Register a new application in AAD

- Follow [Documentation to register a new application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) in the Azure Active Directory (in the Azure portal).
- Note down the `CLIENT_ID` and `TENANT_ID`.
- In the "Certificates & Secrets" tab, create a secret and note that down.

### Allow your registered application to access your Key Vault

- In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Key Vault.
- In the left-side-navbar of your Azure Key Vault in the Azure portal, go to the `Access Policies` section, then click the `+ Add Access Policy` button.
- In the `Add access policy` page, select all the permissions for Keys, Secrets and Certificates.
- For the `Select principal` field, click on the `None selected`. A panel will appear at the right of the window. Search for your Azure Active Directory application, click the application on the search results, then click "Select" at the bottom.
- Once your application is selected, click the "Add" button.
- Click the `Save` button at the top of the Access Policies section of your Key Vault.
