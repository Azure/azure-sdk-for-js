# 2019-04-05 1.0.0-preview.2

### Breaking Changes

The second preview of the @azure/service-bus library has the below breaking changes from the previous
version:

#### Name changes

Some of our classes and functions have undergone a naming change to better describe what they are
meant to do.

* The `Namespace` class is renamed to `ServiceBusClient`
* The function to get a sender, `getSender` is renamed to `createSender`. It will now throw an error
 if an open sender already exists on the `QueueClient`/`SubscriptionClient`. If a previously created
 sender was closed, then this will create a new sender.
* The function to get a receiver, `getReceiver` is renamed to `createReceiver`. It will now throw an error
 if an open receiver already exists on the `QueueClient`/`SubscriptionClient`. If a previously created
 receiver was closed, then this will create a new receiver.
* The function to get a receiver for a session enabled Queue/Subsciption, `getSessionReceiver` is no
longer supported. Use `createReceiver` instead and pass the `sessionOptions` parameter to provide
`sessionId` and the duration until which you want to lock the session.
* `send` and `sendBatch` functions on the sender are renamed to `sendMessage` and `sendMessages`
* `receive` and `receiveBatch` functions on the reciever are renamed to `registerMessageHandler` and
`receiveMessages`
* A third way of receiving messages is introduced on the receiver via `getMessageIterator` function
which returns an async iterator over messages.

#### Authentication

- If you have been using the `createFromAadTokenCredentials` function to create an instance of the 
`Namespace` class (which is now `ServiceBusClient`), you will now need to use the
[@azure/ms-rest-nodeauth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/ms-rest-nodeauth) 
library instead of [ms-rest-azure](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms-rest-azure) library to create 
the credentials that are needed by the `createFromAadTokenCredentials` function.
    - Typescript: Replace `import * from "ms-rest-azure";` with `import * from "@azure/ms-rest-nodeauth";`
    - Javascript: Replace `require("ms-rest-azure")` with `require("@azure/ms-rest-nodeauth")`

### Bug fixes

- Fixed [Bug 1611](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/1611) where we could not receive 
 more than 2047 messages in a single receiver when in `ReceiveAndDelete` mode. 
- Fixed [Bug 1098](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/1098) where precision was lost
on the messageId when a number is passed.
- A network connection lost error is now treated as retryable error. A new error with name `ConnectionLostError` 
is introduced for this scenario which you can see if you enable the [logs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/servicebus/service-bus#enable-logs).
- When recovering from an error that caused the underlying AMQP connection to get disconnected, 
[rhea](https://github.com/amqp/rhea/issues/205) reconnects all the older AMQP links on the connection 
resulting in the below 2 errors in the logs. We now clear rhea's internal map to avoid such reconnections. 
We already have code in place to create new AMQP links to resume send/receive operations. Fixes
[Bug 1268](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/1268)
    - InvalidOperationError: A link to connection '.....' $cbs node has already been opened.
    - UnauthorizedError: Unauthorized access. 'Listen' claim(s) are required to perform this operation.
