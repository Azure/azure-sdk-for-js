 * This sample demonstrates how to create a namespace using AAD token credentials
 * obtained from using Service Principal Secrets.
 *
 *  Setup:
 *    Please ensure that your Azure Service Bus resource is in US East, US East 2, or West Europe
 *    region. AAD Role Based Access Control is not supported in other regions yet.
 *
 *    Register a new application in AAD and assign the "Azure Service Bus Data Owner" role to it
 *      - See https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app
 *        to register a new application in the Azure Active Directory.
 *      - Note down the CLIENT_ID and TENANT_ID from the above step.
 *      - In the "Certificates & Secrets" tab, create a secret and note that down.
 *      - In the Azure portal, go to your Service Bus resource and click on the Access control (IAM)
 *        tab. Here, assign "Azure Service Bus Data Owner" role to the registered application.
