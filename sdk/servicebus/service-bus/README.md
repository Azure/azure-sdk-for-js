## Getting Started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Service Bus client library using npm

`npm install @azure/service-bus@dev`

**Prerequisites**: You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and a
[Service Bus Namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/) to use this package.
If you are using this package in a Node.js application, then use Node.js 8.x or higher.

### Configure Typescript

TypeScript users need to have Node type definitions installed:

```bash
npm install @types/node
```

You also need to enable `compilerOptions.allowSyntheticDefaultImports` in your tsconfig.json. Note that if you have enabled `compilerOptions.esModuleInterop`, `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` is enabled by default. See [TypeScript's compiler options handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) for more information.

### Authenticate the client

Interaction with Service Bus starts with an instance of the [ServiceBusClient](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/classes/servicebusclient.html) class.

You can instantiate this class using its constructors:

- [Create using a connection string](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/classes/servicebusclient.html#constructor)
  - This method takes the connection string to your Service Bus instance. You can get the connection string
    from the Azure portal.
- [Create using a TokenCredential](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/classes/servicebusclient.html#constructor)
  - This method takes the host name of your Service Bus instance and a credentials object that you need
    to generate using the [@azure/identity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity)
    library. The host name is of the format `name-of-service-bus-instance.servicebus.windows.net`.

### Key concepts

Once you have initialized the [ServiceBusClient](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/classes/servicebusclient.html)
class, create a sender or receiver based on whether you want to send or receive messages.
to interact with existing Service Bus entities.

Please note that the Queues, Topics and Subscriptions should be created prior to using this library.

### Examples

The following sections provide code snippets that cover some of the common tasks using Azure Service Bus

- [Send messages](#send-messages)
- [Receive messages](#receive-messages)
- [Settle a message](#settle-a-message)
- [Send messages using Sessions](#send-messages-using-sessions)
- [Receive messages using Sessions](#receive-messages-using-sessions)

### Send messages

Once you have created an instance of a `ServiceBusClient` class, you can get a `Sender`
using the [getSender](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/classes/servicebusclient.html#getsender) method.

This gives you a sender which you can use to [send](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/interfaces/sender.html#send)
messages.

You can also use the [sendBatch](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/interfaces/sender.html#sendbatch)
method to efficiently send multiple messages in a single send.

```javascript
const sender = serviceBusClient.getSender("my-queue");
await sender.send({
  body: "my-message-body"
});

const batch = await sender.createBatch();

// NOTE: tryAdd() returns false if the message could not
// be added because the batch is at capacity.
batch.tryAdd({ body: "my-message-body-1" });
batch.tryAdd({ body: "my-message-body-2" });
batch.tryAdd({ body: "my-message-body-3" });

await sender.sendBatch(batch);
```

### Receive messages

Once you have created an instance of a `ServiceBusClient` class, you can get a `Receiver`
using the [getReceiver](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/classes/servicebusclient.html#getreceiver) function.

```javascript
const receiver = serviceBusClient.getReceiver("my-queue", "peekLock");
```

You can use this receiver in one of 3 ways to receive messages:

#### Get an array of messages

Use the [receiveBatch](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/interfaces/receiver.html#receivebatch) function which returns a promise that
resolves to an array of messages.

```javascript
const myMessages = await receiver.receiveBatch(10);
```

#### Subscribe using a message handler

Use the [subscribe](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/interfaces/receiver.html#subscribe) method
to set up message handlers and have it running as long as you need.

When you are done, call `receiver.close()` to stop receiving any more messages.

```javascript
const myMessageHandler = async (message) => {
  // your code here
};
const myErrorHandler = async (error) => {
  console.log(error);
};
receiver.subscribe({
  processMessage: myMessageHandler,
  processError: myErrorHandler
});
```

#### Use async iterator

Use the [getMessageIterator](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/interfaces/receiver.html#getmessageiterator) to get an async iterator over messages

```javascript
for await (let message of receiver.getMessageIterator()) {
  // your code here
}
```

### Settle a message

Once you receive a message you can call `complete()`, `abandon()`, `defer()` or `deadletter()` on it
based on how you want to settle the message.

To learn more, please read [Settling Received Messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-transfers-locks-settlement#settling-receive-operations)

### Send messages using Sessions

To send messages using sessions, you first need to create a session enabled Queue or Subscription. You can do this
in the Azure portal. Then, use an instance of a `ServiceBusClient` to create a sender using the using
the [getSender](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/classes/servicebusclient.html#getsender)
function. This gives you a sender which you can use to [send](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/interfaces/sender.html#send) messages.

When sending the message, set the `sessionId` property in the message body to ensure your message
lands in the right session.

```javascript
const sender = serviceBusClient.getSender("my-session-queue");
await sender.send({
  body: "my-message-body",
  sessionId: "my-session"
});
```

### Receive messages from Sessions

To receive messages from sessions, you first need to create a session enabled Queue and send messages
to it. Then, use an instance of `ServiceBusClient` to create a receiver
using the [getSessionReceiver](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/javascript/azure-service-bus/5.0.0-preview.1/classes/servicebusclient.html#getsessionreceiver) function.

Note that you will need to specify the session from which you want to receive messages.

```javascript
const receiver = serviceBusClient.getSessionReceiver("my-session-queue", "peekLock", {
  sessionId: "my-session"
});
```

You can use this receiver in one of 3 ways to receive messages

- [Get an array of messages](#get-an-array-of-messages)
- [Subscribe using a message handler](#subscribe-using-a-message-handler)
- [Use async iterator](#use-async-iterator)

## Troubleshooting

## AMQP Dependencies

The Service Bus library depends on the [rhea-promise](https://github.com/amqp/rhea-promise) library for managing connections, sending and receiving messages over the [AMQP](http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-complete-v1.0-os.pdf) protocol.

### Enable logs

You can set the following environment variable to get the debug logs when using this library.

- Getting debug logs from the Service Bus SDK

```bash
export DEBUG=azure*
```

- Getting debug logs from the Service Bus SDK and the protocol level library.

```bash
export DEBUG=azure*,rhea*
```

- If you are **not interested in viewing the message transformation** (which consumes lot of console/disk space) then you can set the `DEBUG` environment variable as follows:

```bash
export DEBUG=azure*,rhea*,-rhea:raw,-rhea:message,-azure:core-amqp:datatransformer
```

- If you are interested only in **errors**, then you can set the `DEBUG` environment variable as follows:

```bash
export DEBUG=azure:service-bus:error,azure-core-amqp:error,rhea-promise:error,rhea:events,rhea:frames,rhea:io,rhea:flow
```

### Logging to a file

- Set the `DEBUG` environment variable as shown above and then run your test script as follows:
  - Logging statements from your test script go to `out.log` and logging statements from the sdk go to `debug.log`.
    ```bash
    node your-test-script.js > out.log 2>debug.log
    ```
  - Logging statements from your test script and the sdk go to the same file `out.log` by redirecting stderr to stdout (&1), and then redirect stdout to a file:
    ```bash
    node your-test-script.js >out.log 2>&1
    ```
  - Logging statements from your test script and the sdk go to the same file `out.log`.
    ```bash
      node your-test-script.js &> out.log
    ```
