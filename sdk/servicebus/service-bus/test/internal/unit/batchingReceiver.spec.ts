    // We've had an issue in the past where it seemed that drain was
    // causing us to potentially not return messages that should have
    // existed. In our tests this is very hard to reproduce because it
    // requires us to control more of how the stream of events are
    // returned in Service Bus.

    // Our suspicion has been that it's possible we're receiving messages _after_ a
    // drain has occurred but we've never seen it in the wild or in any of our testing.

    // However, in rhea-promise there is an odd mismatch of dispatching that can cause this
    // sequence of events to occur:
    // 1. rhea-promise: receive message A
    //    rhea-promise then calls: setTimeout(emit(messageA))
    // 2. us: decide to drain (timeout expired)
    // 3. rhea-promise: sends drain
    // 4. rhea-promise: receives message B (Service Bus has not yet processed the drain request)
    //    rhea-promise then calls: setTimeout(emit(messageB))
    //
    // Now at this point we have the setTimeout(emit(messageB)) in the task queue. It'll be
    // executed at the next turn of the event loop.
    //
    // The problem then comes in when rhea-promise receives the receiver_drained event:
    // 4. rhea-promise: receives receiver_drain event
    //    emit(drain)     // note it does _not_ use setTimeout()
    //
    // This causes the drain event to fire immediately. When it resolves the underlying promise
    // it resolves it prior to emit(messageB) firing, resulting in lost messages.
    //
    // To fix this when we get receive_drained we setTimeout(resolve) instead of just immediately resolving. This allows
    // us to enter into the same task queue as all the message callbacks, and makes it so everything occurs in the
    // right order.
