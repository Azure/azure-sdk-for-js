# Getting started with samples #

## Install the library

Copy the samples folder, then run npm install inside it in order to
install the npm package for Azure Service Bus library.

If you want to copy individual sample files and run them outside,
remember to install the service-bus package with:

    npm install @azure/service-bus

## Get connection string for Service Bus & names for Queues/Topics/Subscriptions
- In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to **Dashboard > Service Bus > _your-servicebus-namespace_**.
- If you don't have a Service Bus resource, then here are the docs which can help you create a Service Bus resource in the portal : [Service Bus - Node.js docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-nodejs-how-to-use-queues).
- Note down the "Primary Connection String" of **RootManageSharedAccessKey** at **Shared access policies** under **Settings** tab.
- To work with Queues, find the "Queues" tab right under "Entities" at **_your-servicebus-namespace_**, create a Queue and note down its name.
- To work with Topics, find the "Topics" tab right under "Entities" at **_your-servicebus-namespace_**, create a Topic. Go to **_your-servicebus-namespace_ > _your-topic_**, create subscriptions for the topic. Note down the names of the topic and subscriptions.
> _Note : **RootManageSharedAccessKey** is automatically created for the namespace and has permissions for the entire namespace. If you want to use restricted access, refer [Shared Access Signatures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-sas), create the Access Keys exclusive to the specific created Queue/Topic._

Before running any of the samples, update it with the connection string and the queue/topic/subscription names you have noted down above.

## Running a Javascript sample

Copy the sample to your samples folder and use `node` to run it.
```bash
node sample.js
```

## Running a Typescript sample

If you don't have Typescript installed, then use `npm` to install it first.
```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

One way to run Typescript samples is to use `ts-node`. To install `ts-node`, run the below in your sample folder
```bash
npm install ts-node
```

Copy the sample to your samples folder and use `ts-node` to run it.
```bash
ts-node sample.ts
```
