# Example streaming chat app using Azure OpenAI JS SDK

To run this project, first update your Azure values in the .sampleenv file and rename the file to .env.

Then, from the CLI run:

1.
```
npm install
```

2.
```
npm run server
```

After the server has started, open the public/index.html file in a browser. Asking a question in the Input Prompt field and clicking "Start Chat" should produce a streaming response.
