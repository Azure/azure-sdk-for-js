# Azure Form Recognizer client library for JavaScript

Azure Cognitive Services [Form Recognizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/) is a cloud service that uses machine learning to recognize text and table data
from form documents. It includes the following main functionalities:

* Custom models - Recognize field values and table data from forms. These models are trained with your own data, so they're tailored to your forms. You can then take these custom models and recognize forms. You can also manage the custom models you've created and see how close you are to the limit of custom models your account can hold.
* Content API - Recognize text and table structures, along with their bounding box coordinates, from documents. Corresponds to the REST service's Layout API.
* Prebuilt receipt model - Recognize data from sales receipts using a prebuilt model.

**Note:** This package targets Azure Form Recognizer service API version 2.0.

## Getting started


### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.x.x or higher
- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
- A [Cognitive Services or Form Recognizer resource][FR_or_CS_resource] If you need to create the resource, you can use the [Azure Portal][azure_portal] or [Azure CLI][azure_cli].

#### Create a Form Recognizer resource
Form Recognizer supports both [multi-service and single-service access][multi_and_single_service].
Create a Cognitive Services resource if you plan to access multiple cognitive services under a single endpoint/key. For Form Recognizer access only, create a Form Recognizer resource.

You can create the resource using

**Option 1:** [Azure Portal][azure_portal_create_FR_resource]

**Option 2:** [Azure CLI][azure_cli_create_FR_resource].
Below is an example of how you can create a Form Recognizer resource using the CLI:

```bash
# Create a new resource group to hold the form recognizer resource -
# if using an existing resource group, skip this step
az group create --name my-resource-group --location westus2
```

If you use the Azure CLI, replace `<your-resource-group-name>` and `<your-resource-name>` with your own unique names:

```bash
az cognitiveservices account create --kind FormRecognizer --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-resource-name> --sku <your-sku-name> --location <your-location>
```

### Install the `@azure/ai-form-recognizer` package

Install the Azure Form Recognizer client library for JavaScript with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @azure/ai-form-recognizer
```

### Create and authenticate a client

In order to interact with the Form Recognizer service, you'll need to select either a `FormRecognizerClient` or a `FormTrainingClient`, and create an instance of this type.  In the following samples, we will use `FormRecognizerClient` as an example.  To create a client instance to access the Form Recognizer API, you will need the `endpoint` of your Form Recognizer resource and a `credential`. The Form Recognizer client use an API key credential to authenticate.

You can find the endpoint for your form recognizer resource either in the [Azure Portal][azure_portal] or by using the [Azure CLI][azure_cli] snippet below:

```bash
az cognitiveservices account show --name <your-resource-name> --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --query "endpoint"
```

#### Using an API Key

Use the [Azure Portal][azure_portal] to browse to your Form Recognizer resource and retrieve an API key, or use the [Azure CLI][azure_cli] snippet below:

**Note:** Sometimes the API key is referred to as a "subscription key" or "subscription API key."

```bash
az cognitiveservices account keys list --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-resource-name>
```

Once you have an API key and endpoint, you can use it as follows:

```js
const { FormRecognizerClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-form-recognizer");

const client = new FormRecognizerClient("<endpoint>", new AzureKeyCredential("<API key>"));
```

#### Using an Azure Active Directory Credential

Client API key authentication is used in most of the examples, but you can also authenticate with Azure Active Directory using the [Azure Identity library][azure_identity]. To use the [DefaultAzureCredential][defaultazurecredential] \
provider shown below,
or other credential providers provided with the Azure SDK, please install the `@azure/identity` package:

```bash
npm install @azure/identity
```

You will also need to [register a new AAD application][register_aad_app] and grant access to Form Recognizer by assigning the `"Cognitive Services User"` role to your service principal (note: other roles such as `"Owner"` will not gra\
nt the necessary permissions, only `"Cognitive Services User"` will suffice to run the examples and the sample code).

Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as environment variables: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

```js
const { FormRecognizerClient } = require("@azure/ai-form-recognizer");
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");

const client = new FormRecognizerClient("<endpoint>", new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

## Key concepts


### FormRecognizerClient
`FormRecognizerClient` provides operations for:

 - Recognizing form fields and content using custom models trained to recognize your custom forms. These values are returned in a collection of `RecognizedForm` objects.
 - Recognizing form content, including tables, lines and words, without the need to train a model. Form content is returned in a collection of `FormPage` objects.
 - Recognizing common fields from receipts, using a pre-trained receipt model on the Form Recognizer service. These fields and meta-data are returned in a collection of `RecognizedReceipt`.

### FormTrainingClient
`FormTrainingClient` provides operations for:

- Training custom models to recognize all fields and values found in your custom forms. A `CustomFormModel` is returned indicating the form types the model will recognize, and the fields it will extract for each form type. See the [service's documentation on unlabeled model training][fr-train-without-labels] for a more detailed explanation of creating a training data set.
- Training custom models to recognize specific fields and values you specify by labeling your custom forms. A `CustomFormModel` is returned indicating the fields the model will extract, as well as the estimated accuracy for each field. See the [service's documentation on labeled model training][fr-train-with-labels] for a more detailed explanation of applying labels to a training data set.
- Managing models created in your account.
- Copying a custom model from one Form Recognizer resource to another.

Please note that models can also be trained using a graphical user interface such as the [Form Recognizer Labeling Tool][fr-labeling-tool].

Sample code snippets that illustrate the use of `FormTrainingClient` can be found [below](#train-a-model).

### Long-Running Operations
Long-running operations are operations which consist of an initial request sent to the service to start an operation,followed by polling the service at intervals to determine whether the operation has completed or failed, and if it has succeeded, to get the result.

Methods that train models or extract values from forms are modeled as long-running operations.  The client exposes a `begin<operation-name>` method that returns an `Promise<PollerLike>`.  Callers should wait for the operation to complete by calling `pollUntilDone()` on the poller returned from the `begin<operation-name>` method.  Sample code snippets are provided
to illustrate using long-running operations [below](#examples).

## Examples
The following section provides several JavaScript code snippets illustrating common patterns used in the Form Recognizer client libraries.

* [Recognize Forms Using a Custom Model](#recognize-forms-using-a-custom-model)
* [Recognize Content](#recognize-content)
* [Recognize Receipts](#recognize-receipts)
* [Train a Model](#train-a-model)
* [Listing All Models](#listing-all-models)

### Recognize Forms Using a Custom Model

Recognize name/value pairs and table data from forms. These models are trained with your own data, so they're tailored to your forms. A custom model should only be used with forms of the same document structure as those used to train the model.

```javascript
const { FormRecognizerClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-form-recognizer");

const fs = require("fs");

async function main() {
  const endpoint = "<cognitive services endpoint>";
  const apiKey = "<api key>";
  const modelId = "<model id>";
  const path = "<path to a form document>";

  const readStream = fs.createReadStream(path);

  const client = new FormRecognizerClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));
  const poller = await client.beginRecognizeCustomForms(modelId, readStream, "application/pdf", {
    onProgress: (state) => { console.log(`status: ${state.status}`); }
  });
  const forms = await poller.pollUntilDone();

  console.log("Forms:");
  for (const form of forms || []) {
    console.log(`${form.formType}, page range: ${form.pageRange}`);
    console.log("Pages:");
    for (const page of form.pages || []) {
      console.log(`Page number: ${page.pageNumber}`);
      console.log("Tables");
      for (const table of page.tables || []) {
        for (const cell of table.cells) {
          console.log(`cell (${cell.rowIndex},${cell.columnIndex}) ${cell.text}`);
        }
      }
    }

    console.log("Fields:");
    for (const fieldName in form.fields) {
      // each field is of type FormField
      const field = form.fields[fieldName];
      console.log(
        `Field ${fieldName} has value '${field.value}' with a confidence score of ${field.confidence}`
      );
    }
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});
```

Alternatively, a form URL can be used to recognize custom forms using the `beginRecognizeCustomFormsFromUrl` method. Methods
with a `FromUrl` suffix that use URLs instead of streams exist for all of the recognition methods.

### Recognize Content

Recognize text and table structures, along with their bounding box, from documents

```javascript
const { FormRecognizerClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-form-recognizer");

const fs = require("fs");

async function main() {
  const endpoint = "<cognitive services endpoint>";
  const apiKey = "<api key>";
  const path = "<path to your receipt document>"; // pdf/jpeg/png/tiff formats

  const readStream = fs.createReadStream(path);

  const client = new FormRecognizerClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));
  const poller = await client.beginRecognizeContent(readStream);
  const pages = await poller.pollUntilDone();

  if (!pages || pages.length === 0) {
    throw new Error("Expecting non-empty list of pages!");
  }

  for (const page of pages) {
    console.log(
      `Page ${page.pageNumber}: width ${page.width} and height ${page.height} with unit ${page.unit}`
    );
    for (const table of page.tables) {
      for (const cell of table.cells) {
        console.log(`cell [${cell.rowIndex},${cell.columnIndex}] has text ${cell.text}`);
      }
    }
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});
```

### Recognize Receipts

Recognize data from USA sales receipts using the pre-built model. A list of receipt fields recognized by the service can be found [here](https://aka.ms/azsdk/formrecognizer/receiptfields).

```javascript
const { FormRecognizerClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-form-recognizer");

const fs = require("fs");

async function main() {
  const endpoint = "<cognitive services endpoint>";
  const apiKey = "<api key>";
  const path = "<path to your receipt document>"; // pdf/jpeg/png/tiff formats

  const readStream = fs.createReadStream(path);

  const client = new FormRecognizerClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));
  const poller = await client.beginRecognizeReceipts(readStream, "image/jpeg", {
    onProgress: (state) => { console.log(`status: ${state.status}`); }
  });

  const receipts = await poller.pollUntilDone();

  if (!receipts || receipts.length <= 0) {
    throw new Error("Expecting at lease one receipt in analysis result");
  }

  const receipt = receipts[0];
  console.log("First receipt:");
  const receiptTypeField = receipt.fields["ReceiptType"];
  if (receiptTypeField.valueType === "string") {
    console.log(`  Receipt Type: '${receiptTypeField.value || "<missing>"}', with confidence of ${receiptTypeField.confidence}`);
  }
  const merchantNameField = receipt.fields["MerchantName"];
  if (merchantNameField.valueType === "string") {
    console.log(`  Merchant Name: '${merchantNameField.value || "<missing>"}', with confidence of ${merchantNameField.confidence}`);
  }
  const transactionDate = receipt.fields["TransactionDate"];
  if (transactionDate.valueType === "date") {
    console.log(`  Transaction Date: '${transactionDate.value || "<missing>"}', with confidence of ${transactionDate.confidence}`);
  }
  const itemsField = receipt.fields["Items"];
  if (itemsField.valueType === "array") {
    for (const itemField of itemsField.value || []) {
      if (itemField.valueType === "object") {
        const itemNameField = itemField.value["Name"];
        if (itemNameField.valueType === "string") {
          console.log(`    Item Name: '${itemNameField.value || "<missing>"}', with confidence of ${itemNameField.confidence}`);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  const totalField = receipt.fields["Total"];
  if (totalField.valueType === "number") {
    console.log(`  Total: '${totalField.value || "<missing>"}', with confidence of ${totalField.confidence}`);
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});
```

### Train a Model

Train a machine-learned model on your own form type. The resulting model will be able to recognize values from the types of forms it was trained on. Provide a container SAS url to your Azure Storage Blob container where you're storing the training documents. See details on setting this up in the [service quickstart documentation][quickstart_training]. This sample creates and trains a custom model without using labels.

```javascript
const { FormTrainingClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-form-recognizer");

async function main() {
  const endpoint = "<cognitive services endpoint>";
  const apiKey = "<api key>";
  const containerSasUrl = "<SAS url to the blob container storing training documents>";

  const trainingClient = new FormTrainingClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));

  const poller = await trainingClient.beginTraining(containerSasUrl, false, {
    onProgress: (state) => { console.log(`training status: ${state.status}`); }
  });
  const model = await poller.pollUntilDone();

  if (!model) {
    throw new Error("Expecting valid training result!");
  }

  console.log(`Model ID: ${model.modelId}`);
  console.log(`Status: ${model.status}`);
  console.log(`Training started on: ${model.trainingStartedOn}`);
  console.log(`Training completed on: ${model.trainingCompletedOn}`);

  if (model.submodels) {
    for (const submodel of model.submodels) {
      // since the training data is unlabeled, we are unable to return the accuracy of this model
      console.log("We have recognized the following fields");
      for (const key in submodel.fields) {
        const field = submodel.fields[key];
        console.log(`The model found field '${field.name}'`);
      }
    }
  }
  // Training document information
  if (model.trainingDocuments) {
    for (const doc of model.trainingDocuments) {
      console.log(`Document name: ${doc.name}`);
      console.log(`Document status: ${doc.status}`);
      console.log(`Document page count: ${doc.pageCount}`);
      console.log(`Document errors: ${doc.errors}`);
    }
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});
```

For information on creating a labeled training data set, see the documentation for the [using the sample labeling tool][quickstart_labeling] and the [labeled model training sample][labeled_sample].

### Listing All Models

Listing custom models in the current cognitive service account. This sample shows several ways to iterate through the result.

```javascript
const { FormTrainingClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-form-recognizer");

async function main() {
  const endpoint = "<cognitive services endpoint>";
  const apiKey = "<api key>";
  const client = new FormTrainingClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));

  // returns an async iteratable iterator that supports paging
  const result = client.listCustomModels();
  let i = 0;
  for await (const modelInfo of result) {
    console.log(`model ${i++}:`);
    console.log(modelInfo);
  }

  // using `iter.next()`
  i = 1;
  let iter = client.listCustomModels();
  let modelItem = await iter.next();
  while (!modelItem.done) {
    console.log(`model ${i++}: ${modelItem.value.modelId}`);
    modelItem = await iter.next();
  }

  // using `byPage()`
  i = 1;
  for await (const response of client.listCustomModels().byPage()) {
    for (const modelInfo of response.modelList) {
      console.log(`model ${i++}: ${modelInfo.modelId}`);
    }
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});

```
