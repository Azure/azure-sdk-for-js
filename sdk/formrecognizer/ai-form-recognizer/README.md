# Azure Form Recognizer client library for JavaScript

[Form Recognizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/) is a cloud-based service that uses machine learning to extract text and table data from form documents. It allows you to train custom models using your own forms, to extract field names and values, and table data from them.  It also provides a prebuilt models you can use to extract values from receipts, or tables from any form.

## Getting started

### Currently supported environments

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.x.x or higher

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
- An existing [Cognitive Services][cognitive_resource] or Form Recognizer resource. If you need to create the resource, you can use the [Azure Portal][azure_portal] or [Azure CLI][azure_cli].

If you use the Azure CLI, replace `<your-resource-group-name>` and `<your-resource-name>` with your own unique names:

```bash
az cognitiveservices account create --kind FormRecognizer --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-resource-name>
```

### Install the `@azure/ai-form-recognizer` package

Install the Azure Form Recognizer client library for JavaScript with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @azure/ai-form-recognizer
```

### Create and authenticate a client

In order to interact with the Form Recognizer service, you'll need to select either a `ReceiptClient`, `FormLayoutClient`, or `CustomFormClient`, and create an instance of this type.  In the following samples, we will use `CustomFormClient` as an example.  To create a client instance to access the Form Recognizer API, you will need the `endpoint` of your Form Recognizer resource and a `credential`. The Form Recognizer client use an API key credential to authenticate.

You can find the endpoint for your form recognizer resource either in the [Azure Portal][azure_portal] or by using the [Azure CLI][azure_cli] snippet below:

```bash
az cognitiveservices account show --name <your-resource-name> --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --query "endpoint"
```

#### Using an API Key

Use the [Azure Portal][azure_portal] to browse to your Form Recognizer resource and retrieve an API key, or use the [Azure CLI][azure_cli] snippet below:

**Note:** Sometimes the API key is referred to as a "subscription key" or "subscription API key."

```bash
az cognitiveservices account keys list --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-resource-name>
```

Once you have an API key and endpoint, you can use it as follows:

```js
const { CustomFormClient, ApiKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-form-recognizer");

const client = new CustomFormClient(
  "<endpoint>",
  new ApiKeyCredential("<API key>")
);
```

## Key concepts

### FormRecognizerClient
A `FormRecognizerClient` is the Form Recognizer interface to use for analyzing receipts, recognizing content from forms, and recognizing data from forms using custom trained models. It provides different methods based on inputs from a URL and inputs from a stream.

### FormTrainingClient
A `FormTrainingClient` is the Form Recognizer interface to use for creating, using, and managing custom machine-learned models. It provides operations for training models on forms you provide and operations for viewing and deleting models, as well as understanding how close you are to reaching subscription limits for the number of models you can train.

### Long-Running Operations
Long-running operations are operations which consist of an initial request sent to the service to start an operation,followed by polling the service at intervals to determine whether the operation has completed or failed, and if it has succeeded, to get the result.

Methods that train models or extract values from forms are modeled as long-running operations.  The client exposes a `begin<operation-name>` method that returns an `Promise<PollerLike>`.  Callers should wait for the operation to complete by calling `pollUntilDone()` on the poller returned from the `begin<operation-name>` method.  A sample code snippet is provided to illustrate using long-running operations [below](#recognize-receipts).

### Training models
Using the `FormTrainingClient`, you can train a machine-learned model on your own form type.  The resulting model will be able to extract values from the types of forms it was trained on.

#### Training without labels
A model trained without labels uses unsupervised learning to understand the layout and relationships between field names and values in your forms. The learning algorithm clusters the training forms by type and learns what fields and tables are present in each form type.

This approach doesn't require manual data labeling or intensive coding and maintenance, and we recommend you try this method first when training custom models.

#### Training with labels
A model trained with labels uses supervised learning to extract values you specify by adding labels to your training forms.  The learning algorithm uses a label file you provide to learn what fields are found at various locations in the form, and learns to extract just those values.

This approach can result in better-performing models, and those models can work with more complex form structures.

### Recognizing values from forms
Using the `FormRecognizerClient`, you can use your own trained models to extract field values and locations, as well as table data, from forms of the type you trained your models on.  The output of models trained with and without labels differs as described below.

#### Using models trained without labels
Models trained without labels consider each form page to be a different form type.  For example, if you train your model on 3-page forms, it will learn that these are three different types of forms.  When you send a form to it for analysis, it will return a collection of three pages, where each page contains the field names, values, and locations, as well as table data, found on that page.

#### Using models trained with labels
Models trained with labels consider a form as a single unit.  For example, if you train your model on 3-page forms with labels, it will learn to extract field values from the locations you've labeled across all pages in the form.  If you sent a document containing two forms to it for analysis, it would return a collection of two forms, where each form contains the field names, values, and locations, as well as table data, found in that form.  Fields and tables have page numbers to identify the pages where they were found.

### Managing Custom Models
Using the `FormTrainingClient`, you can get, list, and delete the custom models you've trained.  You can also view the count of models you've trained and the maximum number of models your subscription will allow you to store.


## Examples
The following section provides several code snippets illustrating common patterns used in the Form Recognizer client libraries.

### Recognize receipts

Recognize data from USA sales receipts using the pre-built model.

```javascript
const { FormRecognizerClient, AzureKeyCredential, toUSReceipt } = require("@azure/ai-form-recognizer");
const fs = require("fs");

async function main() {
  const endpoint = "<cognitive services endpoint>";
  const apiKey = || "<api key>";
  const path = "<path to your receipt document>"; // pdf/jpeg/png/tiff formats

  const readStream = fs.createReadStream(path);

  const client = new FormRecognizerClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));
  const poller = await client.beginRecognizeReceipts(readStream, "image/jpeg", {
    onProgress: (state) => { console.log(`status: ${state.status}`); }
  });

  await poller.pollUntilDone();
  const response = poller.getResult();
  console.log(`### Response status ${response.status}`);

  const usReceipt = response.receipts[0];
  console.log("First receipt:")
  console.log(`Receipt type: ${usReceipt.receiptType}`)
  console.log(`Merchant Name: ${usReceipt.merchantName.value} (confidence: ${usReceipt.merchantName.confidence})`);
  console.log(`Transaction Date: ${usReceipt.transactionDate.value} (confidence: ${usReceipt.transactionDate.confidence})`);
  const items = usReceipt.items.map((item) => {
    return {
      name: `${item.name.value} (confidence: ${item.name.confidence})`,
      price: `${item.price.value} (confidence: ${item.price.confidence})`,
      quantity: `${item.quantity.value} (confidence: ${item.quantity.confidence})`,
      totalPrice: `${item.totalPrice.value} (confidence: ${item.totalPrice.confidence})`
    }
  });
  console.log("Receipt items:");
  console.table(items, ["name", "price", "quantity", "totalPrice"]);

  // raw fields are also included in the result
  console.log("Raw 'MerchantAddress' fields:");
  console.log(usReceipt.recognizedForm.fields["MerchantAddress"]);
}

main();
```

### Recognize content

Recognize text and table structures, along with their bounding box, from documents

```javascript
const { FormRecognizerClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-form-recognizer");
const fs = require("fs");

async function main() {
  const endpoint = "<cognitive services endpoint>";
  const apiKey = || "<api key>";
  const path = "<path to your receipt document>"; // pdf/jpeg/png/tiff formats

  const readStream = fs.createReadStream(path);

  const client = new FormRecognizerClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));
  const poller = await client.beginRecognizeContent(readStream);
  await poller.pollUntilDone();
  const response = poller.getResult();

  if (!response) {
    throw new Error("Expecting valid response!");
  }

  console.log(response.status);
  for (const page of response.pages) {
    console.log(`Page ${page.pageNumber}: width ${page.width} and height ${page.height} with unit ${page.unit}`);
    for (const table of page.tables) {
      for (const row of table.rows) {
        for (const cell of row.cells) {
          console.log(`cell [${cell.rowIndex},${cell.columnIndex}] has text ${cell.text}`);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

main();
```

### Train model

Train a machine-learned model on your own form type. The resulting model will be able to recognize values from the types of forms it was trained on. Provide a container SAS url to your Azure Storage Blob container where you're storing the training documents. See details on setting this up in the [service quickstart documentation](servicequickstart).

```javascript
const { FormRecognizerClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-form-recognizer");

async function main() {
  const endpoint = "<cognitive services endpoint>";
  const apiKey = "<api key>";
  const containerSasUrl = "<SAS url to the blob container storing training documents>";

  const client = new FormRecognizerClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));
  const trainingClient = client.getFormTrainingClient();

  const poller = await trainingClient.beginTraining(containerSasUrl, false, {
    onProgress: (state) => { console.log(`training status: ${state.status}`); }
  });

  await poller.pollUntilDone();
  const response = poller.getResult();
}

main();
```

### Recognize forms using a custom model

```javascript
const { FormRecognizerClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-form-recognizer");

async function main() {
  const endpoint = "<cognitive services endpoint>";
  const apiKey = "<api key>";
  const modelId = "<model id>";
  const path = "<path to a form document>";

  const readStream = fs.createReadStream(path);

  const client = new FormRecognizerClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));
  const poller = await client.beginRecognizeForms(modelId, readStream, "application/pdf", {
    onProgress: (state) => { console.log(`status: ${state.status}`); }
  });
  await poller.pollUntilDone();
  const response = poller.getResult();

  console.log(response.status);
  console.log("Forms:")
  for (const form of response.forms || []) {
    console.log(`${form.formType}, page range: ${form.pageRange}`);
    console.log("Fields:");
    for (const fieldName in form.fields) {
      // each field is of type FormField
      const field = form.fields[fieldName];
      console.log(`Field ${fieldName} has value '${field.value}' with a confidence score of ${field.confidence}`)
    }
  }

  console.log("Errors:");
  console.log(response.errors);
}

main()
```

### Listing all models in the current cognitive service account

```javascript
const { FormRecognizerClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-form-recognizer");

async function main() {
  const endpoint = "<cognitive services endpoint>";
  const apiKey = "<api key>";
  const client = new FormRecognizerClient(endpoint, new FormRecognizerApiKeyCredential(apiKey));
  const trainingClient = client.getFormTrainingClient();

  // returns an async iteratable iterator that supports paging
  const result = await trainingClient.listModels();
  let i = 0;
  for await (const modelInfo of result) {
    console.log(`model ${i++}:`);
    console.log(modelInfo);
  }

  // using `iter.next()`
  i = 1;
  let iter = client.listModels();
  let modelItem = await iter.next();
  while (!modelItem.done) {
    console.log(`model ${i++}: ${modelItem.value.modelId}`);
    modelItem = await iter.next();
  }

  // using `byPage()`
  i = 1;
  for await (const response of client.listModels().byPage()) {
    for (const modelInfo of response.modelList) {
      console.log(`model ${i++}: ${modelInfo.modelId}`);
    }
  }
}

main();
```
