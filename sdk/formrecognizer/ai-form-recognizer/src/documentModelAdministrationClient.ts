   * Build a new model with a given ID from a set of input documents and labeled fields.
   *
   * The Model ID can consist of any text, so long as it does not begin with "prebuilt-" (as these models refer to
   * prebuilt Form Recognizer models that are common to all resources), and so long as it does not already exist within
   * the resource.
   *
   * The Form Recognizer service reads the training data set from an Azure Storage container, given as a URL to the
   * container with a SAS token that allows the service backend to communicate with the container. At a minimum, the
   * "read" and "list" permissions are required. In addition, the data in the given container must be organized
   * according to a particular convention, which is documented in [the service's documentation for building custom
   * models](https://aka.ms/form-recognizer/custom).
