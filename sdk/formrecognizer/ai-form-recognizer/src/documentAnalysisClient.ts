  /**
   * Extract data from an input using a model given by its unique ID.
   *
   * This operation supports custom as well as prebuilt models. For example, to use the prebuilt invoice model, provide
   * the model ID "prebuilt-invoice", or to use the simpler prebuilt layout model, provide the model ID
   * "prebuilt-layout".
   *
   * The fields produced in the `AnalyzeResult` depend on the model that is used for analysis, and the values in any
   * extracted documents' fields depend on the document types in the model (if any) and their corresponding field
   * schemas.
   *
   * ### Examples
   *

   * objects, browser `Blob`s, and `ArrayBuffer`s. The contents of the body will be uploaded to the service for analysis.

   *
   * // The result is a long-running operation (poller), which must itself be polled until the operation completes
   * const {
   *   pages, // pages extracted from the document, which contain lines and words
   *   tables, // extracted tables, organized into cells that contain their contents
   *   styles, // text styles (ex. handwriting) that were observed in the document
   *   keyValuePairs, // extracted pairs of elements  (directed associations from one element in the input to another)
   *   entities, // extracted entities in the input's content, which are categorized (ex. "Location" or "Organization")
   *   documents // extracted documents (instances of one of the model's document types and its field schema)
   * } = await poller.pollUntilDone();
   *
   * // Extract the fields of the first document. These fields constitute a receipt, because we used the receipt model
   * const [{ fields: receipt }] = documents;
   *
