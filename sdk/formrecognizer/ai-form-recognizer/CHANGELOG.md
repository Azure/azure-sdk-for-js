# Release History

## 3.0.0 (2020-08-20)

- This release marks the general availability of the `@azure/ai-form-recognizer` package.

## 3.0.0-preview.1 (2020-08-11)

- Changed the package version to 3.0.0-preview.1 to reduce confusion with older versions of the Azure Form Recognizer SDKs.
- Changed the name of the `options` bag parameter of `beginRecognizeReceipts` and `beginRecognizeReceiptsFromUrl` to `BeginRecognizeReceiptsOptions`.
- Switched to using the generally-available 2.0 service endpoint rather than 2.0-preview.
- Added a `pageNumber` property to the `FormTable` and `FormTableCell` types indicating the number of the page where the table/cell appeared within the input document.
- [Breaking] Renamed the `includeSubFolders` property of the `TrainSourceFilter` type to `includeSubfolders`.
- [Breaking] Renamed the `documentName` property of the `TrainingDocumentInfo` type to just `name`.
- [Breaking] Removed the `containingLine` property of the `FormWord` type.
- Made the `rowSpan`, `columnSpan`, `isHeader`, and `isFooter` properties of the `FormTableCell` type non-optional to reflect that they have default values.
- [Breaking] Renamed `CustomFormField` to `CustomFormModelField` for similarity to other language SDKs.
- [Breaking] Removed the redundant `expirationDateTimeTicks` property from the `CopyAuthorization` type, as the `expiresOn` property exists.
- [Breaking] Moved the optional `contentType` parameter of the `FormRecognizerClient` recognition methods (`recognizeContent`, `recognizeCustomForms`, `recognizeReceipts`, and their URL-based variants) to the associated options bag for these methods.
- [Breaking] Removed exports of several internal types, including most internal poller operation states and some unused types. All client poller implementations now return a smaller subset of fields.

## 1.0.0-preview.4 (2020-07-07)

- [Breaking] Replace `RecognizedReceiptArray` with the more generic `RecognizedFormArray` in the Poller response type returned by `beginRecognizeReceipts` and `beginRecognizeReceiptsFromUrl`.
- Added an `expiresOn` property to the `CopyAuthorization` type containing the time that the Copy Authorization will expire encoded as a JavaScript `Date` type.
- [Breaking] Rename the `textContent` field of the `FieldData` and `FormTableCell` types to `fieldElements` to mirror the change in its type.
- [Breaking] Rename the `FormField` type's `labelText` and `valueText` fields to `labelData` and `valueData` respectively, to mirror the change of their type to `FieldData`;
- [Breaking] Rename the `includeTextContent` request option to `includeFieldElements` to mirror the change to `FieldData` and `FormElement`.
- [Breaking] Rename `FieldText` to `FieldData` and `FormContent` to `FormElement` to reflect that fields may contain more than textual information.
- [Breaking] Rename `includeTextDetails` to `includeTextContent` in custom form and receipt recognition options to be consistent with other languages.
- [Breaking] Rename properties `requestedOn` to `trainingStartedOn` and `completedOn` to `trainingCompletedOn` in `CustomFormModel` and `CustomFormModelInfo` types.

## 1.0.0-preview.3 (2020-06-10)

- Blank pages in receipt recognition are now handled properly.
- Support Azure Active Directory credential.
- Support to copy a custom model from one Form Recognizer resource to another.
- Headers and query parameters which don't contain sensitive information are no longer redacted in logging output.
- Refactoring for cross-language consistency:
  - [Breaking] Rename `beginRecognizeForms()` to `beginRecognizeCustomForms()` in `FormRecognizerClient`.
  - [Breaking] Rename `listModels()` to `listCustomModels()` in `FormTrainingClient`.
  - [Breaking] Rename `count` to `customModelCount` and `limit` to `customModelLimit` in `AccountProperties`.
  - [Breaking] Rename type `ErrorInformation` to `FormRecognizerError`.
  - [Breaking] Rename type `ModelStatus` to `CustomFormModelStatus`.
  - [Breaking] Rename type `CustomFormSubModelField` to `CustomFormField`.

  - [Breaking] Rename type `TrainStatus` to `TrainingStatus`.
  - [Breaking] Rename type `ContentType` to `FormContentType`.
  - [Breaking] Rename type `FormText` to `FieldText`.
  - [Breaking] Rename type `CustomFormSubModel` to `CustomFormSubmodel`.
  - [Breaking] Rename `models` to `submodels` in `CustomFormModel`.
  - [Breaking] Recognition methods and training methods now return the result directly, instead of wrapping them in a response object. Specifically,
    - `beginTraining` now returns `CustomFormModel` instead of `FormModelResponse` from the poller.
    - `beginRecognizeContent` and `beginRecognizeContentFromUrl` now return `FormPageArray` instead of `RecognizeContentResultResponse` from the poller.
    - `beginRecognizeForms` and `beginRecognizeFormsFromUrl` now return `RecognizedFormArray` instead of `RecognizeFormResultResponse` from the poller.
    - `beginRecognizeReceipts` and `beginRecognizeReceiptsFromUrl` now return `RecognizedReceiptArray` instead of `RecognizeReceiptResultResponse` from the poller.
  - [Breaking] Remove `getFormTrainingClient()` from `FormRecognizerClient`. A new method `getFormRecognizerClient()` is added to `FormTrainingClient`
  - [Breaking] `useTrainingLabels` parameter is now required for `beginTraining()` method.
  - [Breaking] Rename `intervalInMs` to `updateIntervalInMs` for all LRO poller options.
  - [Breaking] Remove `USReceipt` and assoicated types.
  - Rename the first parameter of `beginRecognizeContent()` from `data` to `form`.
  - Rename the second parameter of `beginRecognizeForms()` from `data` to `form`.
  - Rename the first parameter of `beginRecognizeReceipts()` from `data` to `receipt`.
  - Rename the first parameter of `beginRecognizeContentFromUrl()` from `documentUrl` to `formUrl`.
  - Rename the second parameter of `beginRecognizeFormsFromUrl()` from `documentUrl` to `formUrl`.
  - Rename the first parameter of `beginRecognizeReceiptsFromUrl()` from `documentUrl` to `receiptUrl`.
  - Rename the first parameter of `beginTraining` from `blobContainerUrl` to `trainingFilesUrl`.

## 1.0.0-preview.2 (2020-05-06)

- `FormTrainingClient.listModels()` now works correctly on NodeJs v8.
- Custom Form recognition now handles missing fields properly.

## 1.0.0-preview.1 (2020-04-23)

- This release is a preview of our efforts to create a client library that is user friendly and
  idiomatic to the JavaScript ecosystem. The reasons for most of the changes in this update can be found in the
  [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for TypeScript](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/typescript_introduction.html).
- Differences from previous public package `@azure/cognitiveservices-formrecognizer`
  - Package name changed from `@azure/cognitiveservices-formrecognizer` to `@azure/ai-form-recognizer`.
  - Package targets version `2.0` of the service API.
