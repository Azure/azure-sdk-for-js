# Release History

## 3.1.0 (2021-05-26)

- This General Availability (GA) release marks the stability of the changes introduced in package versions 3.1.0-beta.1 through 3.1.0-beta.3.
- Changed all names including `IdDocument` to use `IdentityDocument` instead, for example: `BeginRecognizeIdentityDocumentOptions`, `beginRecognizeIdentityDocuments`, and `beginRecognizeIdentityDocumentsFromUrl` for clarity.
- Flattened the `TextStyle` type into the `TextAppearance` type. Rather than having a `style` property with its own `name` and `confidence`, `TextAppearance` now has `styleName` and `styleConfidence` properties.
- Removed the `FormGenderField` type. Any recognized value that was previously produced as a `FormGenderField` is now returned as a `FormStringField` instead (the `value` will remain the same).
- Renamed the `FormCountryField` type to `FormCountryRegionField`, and changed the `valueType` discriminant property of that type to `"countryRegion:`.
- Renamed `ReadingOrder` and `Language` to `FormReadingOrder` and `FormLanguage` to reduce the chance that these types would collide with other types having the same name from other packages.
- Removed the `KnownStyleName`, `KnownSelectionMarkState`, and `KnownKeyValueType` enums, as they represent simple string enums. The `styleName`, `state`, and `valueType` properties (respectively) now have strong string-enum types.
- Added the `KnownFormLocale` enum to access the well-known possible values of form locales (the `locale` property of the options parameters for prebuilt model recognition).
- Migrated to the 2.1 Form Recognizer service endpoint for all REST API calls.

## 3.1.0-beta.3 (2021-04-06)

- Split `FormField` into several different interfaces. This should not cause any API compatibility issues except in certain edge cases (undefined `valueType`), but should result in more accurate type refinement when dealing with FormField values and should significantly improve documentation and code hinting of these values through IntelliSense.
- Added support for recognizing identity documents (such as driver licenses and passports) through the `beginRecognizeIdDocuments` method and its URL-based counterpart `beginRecognizeIdDocumentsFromUrl`. The identity document model is prebuilt and may be used without training a model.
- Introduced two new form field value types: `"gender"` and `"country"`. These value types appear in the identity document recognition responses.
  - The `"gender"` value type signifies the gender or sex of an individual and is represented by a string that is one of three values: "M", "F", or "X".
  - The `"country"` value type indicates a specific country and is represented by a three-letter country code string (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3).
- Added support for the `pages` option to all form recognition methods (custom forms and all prebuilt models). This option works the same as in the content recognition methods, and allows for the specification of which pages within a multi-page document (PDF or TIFF formats) should be considered during analysis and included in the response.
- Added support for a `readingOrder` option to the content recognition methods. This option enables you to control the algorithm that the service uses to determine how recognized lines of text should be ordered.
- Custom model recognition now supports bitmap images through the "image/bmp" content-type (content recognition and all prebuilt models already support this content type).
- Migrated to the 2.1-preview.3 Form Recognizer service endpoint for all REST API calls.

## 3.1.0-beta.2 (2021-02-09)

- Renamed `Appearance` to `TextAppearance`, `Style` to `TextStyle` (previously the name of the enum for `Style.name`, and the `TextStyle` enum to `StyleName` for the sake of clarity in the type names.
- Added `KnownStyleName`, `KnownLanguage`, `KnownSelectionMarkState`, and `KnownKeyValueType` enums to access the well-known possible values of the `StyleName`, `Language`, `SelectionMarkState`, and `KeyValueType` parameters/fields respectively.

## 3.1.0-beta.1 (2020-11-23)

- Added a `pages` option to `BeginRecognizeContentOptions`. This option allows for the specification of which pages of a document to include in the content results. If a value is provided, pages that are not included in the `pages` field will not be analyzed.
- Added an `appearance` property to `FormLine` that contains information about the appearance of the line, such as style (e.g. "handwritten").
- Added an optional `boundingBox` property to `FormTable` that has a bounding box that contains the entire table.
- Added support for the "image/bmp" content type. This content type is supported on all methods that accept a `FormRecognizerRequestBody` **except** for custom form recognition.
- Added a `language` option to `BeginRecognizeContentOptions`. By default, when performing layout/content analysis, the service will attempt to detect the language of the document and supports multi-language inputs. The `language` parameter allows you to override this behavior and force the service to use a specific language.
- Added support for Invoice recognition through the `beginRecognizeInvoices` and `beginRecognizeInvoicesFromUrl` methods. The Invoice model is prebuilt and may be used without training a model.
- Added support for creating composed models through the `beginCreateComposedModel` method of `FormTrainingClient`. It accepts a list of model IDs that refer to labeled custom models that should be composed into a new model.
- Added a `formTypeConfidence` property to `RecognizedForm` indicating the model's confidence in determining the correct form type (and therefore the correct model to use) during recognition.
- Added a `properties` field to `CustomFormModelInfo` that may optionally contain extra properties. Currently, the only property is `isComposedModel` which will indicate whether the model is a composed model or a single trained model.
- Added a `modelId` field to the `CustomFormSubmodel`, `TrainingDocumentInfo`, and `RecognizedForm` types containing the ID of the exact model that they are associated with (for example, in the context of a composed model, the `modelId` field can determine which specific component model is associated with the submodel, training document, or recognized form).
- Added support for selection marks in form fields. In addition to the previously-existing variants of `FormField`, custom models can now return fields with `valueType: "selectionMark"` and their `value` will be the state of the selection mark.
- Added a new page element `FormSelectionMark` that represents marks on a page that can be selected (such as checkboxes and radio buttons). The `selectionMarks` field of `FormPage` contains the selection marks that were recognized in the page. A selection mark has a state value that is either "checked" or "unchecked."
- Made optimizations to the long-running operation infrastructure that should result in faster and more memory-efficient polling for results of custom form recognition, receipt recognition, and business card recognition.
- Added an option for specifying the locale of a document to receipt and business card methods through the `locale` property of the options bag.
- Added support for Business Card recognition through the `beginRecognizeBusinessCards` and `beginRecognizeBusinessCardsFromUrl` methods, which mirror their receipt counterparts. The Invoice model is prebuilt and may be used without training a model.
- Added the `modelName` property to `CustomFormModelInfo`, reflecting the same property that was added to the model training options.
- Altered the type hierarchy so that `CustomFormModel` inherits the properties of `CustomFormModelInfo`.
- Added the `modelName` field to `BeginTrainingOptions`. The given model name will become an immutable property of the trained model.
- Migrated to the 2.1-preview.1 Form Recognizer service endpoint for all REST API calls.

## 3.0.0 (2020-08-20)

- This release marks the general availability of the `@azure/ai-form-recognizer` package.

## 3.0.0-preview.1 (2020-08-11)

- Changed the package version to 3.0.0-preview.1 to reduce confusion with older versions of the Azure Form Recognizer SDKs.
- Changed the name of the `options` bag parameter of `beginRecognizeReceipts` and `beginRecognizeReceiptsFromUrl` to `BeginRecognizeReceiptsOptions`.
- Switched to using the generally-available 2.0 service endpoint rather than 2.0-preview.

- [Breaking] Removed exports of several internal types, including most internal poller operation states and some unused types. All client poller implementations now return a smaller subset of fields.

## 1.0.0-preview.4 (2020-07-07)

- [Breaking] Replace `RecognizedReceiptArray` with the more generic `RecognizedFormArray` in the Poller response type returned by `beginRecognizeReceipts` and `beginRecognizeReceiptsFromUrl`.
- Added an `expiresOn` property to the `CopyAuthorization` type containing the time that the Copy Authorization will expire encoded as a JavaScript `Date` type.
- [Breaking] Rename the `textContent` field of the `FieldData` and `FormTableCell` types to `fieldElements` to mirror the change in its type.
- [Breaking] Rename the `FormField` type's `labelText` and `valueText` fields to `labelData` and `valueData` respectively, to mirror the change of their type to `FieldData`;
- [Breaking] Rename the `includeTextContent` request option to `includeFieldElements` to mirror the change to `FieldData` and `FormElement`.
- [Breaking] Rename `FieldText` to `FieldData` and `FormContent` to `FormElement` to reflect that fields may contain more than textual information.
- [Breaking] Rename `includeTextDetails` to `includeTextContent` in custom form and receipt recognition options to be consistent with other languages.
- [Breaking] Rename properties `requestedOn` to `trainingStartedOn` and `completedOn` to `trainingCompletedOn` in `CustomFormModel` and `CustomFormModelInfo` types.

    - `beginTraining` now returns `CustomFormModel` instead of `FormModelResponse` from the poller.
    - `beginRecognizeContent` and `beginRecognizeContentFromUrl` now return `FormPageArray` instead of `RecognizeContentResultResponse` from the poller.
