# Azure Event Hubs client library express samples for Typescript

This sample programs show how to use the JavaScript client libraries for Azure Event Hubs to send events in the node express framework.
One scenario is building an HTTP-based service that accepts events as part of an HTTP request, then transforms and sends those events into a downstream Event Hub.

| [asyncBatchingProducer.ts][eventproducer] | Demonstrates how the send() function can be used to send events to an Event Hub instance. Support batch send and time trigger. |
| [index.ts][index]                         | Express Http server entry point. Receive http payload and use AsyncBatchingProducer to ingest payload to eventHub.             |

## Prerequisites

The samples are compatible with [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule) and run in express.

You need [an Azure subscription][freesub] and [an Azure Event Hub resource][azhubacct] to run these sample programs.

## Setup

To run the samples using the published version of the package:

1. Install the dependencies using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Compile the sample to JavaScript by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Start the node service on http://localhost:8080:

```bash
npm start
```

4. Call local http server

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"hello":"world"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/ingest
```

## Next Steps

Take a look at our [API Documentation][apiref] for more information about the APIs that are available in the clients.
