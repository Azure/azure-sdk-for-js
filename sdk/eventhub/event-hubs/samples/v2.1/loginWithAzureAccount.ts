  This sample demonstrates how to instantiate EventHubsClient using AAD token credentials
  obtained from signing in through your Azure account.

  Setup :
    Please ensure that your Azure Event Hubs resource is in US East, US East 2, or West Europe
    region. AAD Role Based Access Control is not supported in other regions yet.

    In the Azure portal, go to your Event Hubs resource and click on the Access control (IAM) tab.
    Here, assign "owner" role to your account.

// Define Event Hubs Endpoint and related entity name here here
const evenHubsEndpoint = ""; // <your-eventhubs-namespace>.servicebus.windows.net
const eventHubsName = "";

const username = "";
const password = "";

async function main(): Promise<void> {
  const credentials = await loginWithUsernamePassword(username, password, {
    tokenAudience: "https://eventhubs.azure.net/"
  });
  const client = EventHubClient.createFromAadTokenCredentials(evenHubsEndpoint, eventHubsName, credentials);
  /*
   Refer to other samples, and place your code here
   to send/receive events
