  This sample demonstrates how the subscribe() function can be used to receive events in a stream.

  If your Event Hub instance doesn't have any events, then please run "sendEvents.ts" sample
  to populate it before running this sample.

  Note: If you are using version 2.1.0 or lower of @azure/event-hubs library, then please use the samples at
  https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/%40azure/event-hubs_2.1.0/sdk/eventhub/event-hubs/samples instead.
