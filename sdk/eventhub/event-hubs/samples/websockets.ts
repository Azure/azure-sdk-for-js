  This sample demonstrates how to use WebSockets enable Event Hubs to work over an HTTP proxy and
  in environments where the standard AMQP port 5671 is blocked. For the latter case, ignore proxy
  related configurations in this sample.

  This sample uses 2 external libraries
  - The `ws` library to provide a WebSocket implementation to the Event Hubs library.
  - The `https-proxy-agent` to enable the `ws` library to work with a proxy server.

  Note: If you are using version 2.1.0 or lower of @azure/event-hubs library, then please use the samples at
  https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/%40azure/event-hubs_2.1.0/sdk/eventhub/event-hubs/samples instead.
