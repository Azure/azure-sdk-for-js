  This sample demonstrates how to use the EventHubConsumerClient to process events from all partitions
  of a consumer group in an Event Hubs instance, as well as checkpointing along the way.

  Checkpointing using a durable store allows your application to be more resilient. When you restart
  your application after a crash (or an intentional stop), your application can continue consuming
  events from where it last checkpointed.
  
  If your Event Hub instance doesn't have any events, then please run "sendEvents.ts" sample
  to populate it before running this sample.

  Note: If you are using version 2.1.0 or lower of @azure/event-hubs library, then please use the samples at
  https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/%40azure/event-hubs_2.1.0/sdk/eventhub/event-hubs/samples instead.
