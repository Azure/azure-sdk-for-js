  This sample demonstrates how to receive a given number of events using two different apis.
  We receive events from the first partition in the default consumer group of an Event Hubs instance
  in this sample.

  If your Event Hub instance doesn't have any events, then please run "sendEvents.ts" sample
  to populate it before running this sample.

  Note: If you are using version 2.1.0 or lower of @azure/event-hubs library, then please use the samples at
  https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/%40azure/event-hubs_2.1.0/sdk/eventhub/event-hubs/samples instead.
