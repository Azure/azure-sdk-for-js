  This sample demonstrates how to use the EventHubConsumerClient to process events from all partitions
  of a consumer group in an Event Hubs instance. It also demonstrates the process of checkpointing an event
  which helps new instances of your application that may have spun up for scaling or for crash recovery.

  You will see the use of a Partition Manager which is crucial to balance the load of processing events
  across multiple instances of your application.

  If your Event Hub instance doesn't have any events, then please run "sendEvents.ts" sample
  to populate it before running this sample.

  Note: If you are using version 2.1.0 or lower of @azure/event-hubs library, then please use the samples at
  https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/%40azure/event-hubs_2.1.0/sdk/eventhub/event-hubs/samples instead.
