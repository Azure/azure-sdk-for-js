| [sendBufferedEvents.js][sendbufferedevents]                             | Demonstrates how to send events to an Event Hub using the `EventHubBufferedProducerClient`. This sample is different from the one in `sendEvent.ts` in that the client manages batching of events and sending after a given amount of time or after a given amount of events are in a batch instead of you managing the same explicitly. |

| [usingAadAuth.js][usingaadauth]                                         | Demonstrates how to instantiate EventHubsClient using AAD token credentials obtained from using service principal secrets.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [iothubConnectionString.js][iothubconnectionstring]                     | Demonstrates how to convert an IoT Hub connection string to an Event Hubs connection string that points to the built-in messaging endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Prerequisites

The sample programs are compatible with [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).

You need [an Azure subscription][freesub] and the following Azure resources to run these sample programs:

- [Azure Event Hub][createinstance_azureeventhub]

Samples retrieve credentials to access the service endpoint from environment variables. Alternatively, edit the source code to include the appropriate credentials. See each individual sample for details on which environment variables/credentials it requires to function.

Adapting the samples to run in the browser may require some additional consideration. For details, please see the [package README][package].

## Setup

To run the samples using the published version of the package:

1. Install the dependencies using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Edit the file `sample.env`, adding the correct credentials to access the Azure service and run the samples. Then rename the file from `sample.env` to just `.env`. The sample programs will read this file automatically.

3. Run whichever samples you like (note that some samples may require additional setup, see the table above):

```bash
node sendBufferedEvents.js
```

Alternatively, run a single sample with the correct environment variables set (setting up the `.env` file is not required if you do this), for example (cross-platform):

```bash
npx cross-env EVENTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING="<eventhub connection string>" EVENTHUB_NAME="<eventhub name>" node sendBufferedEvents.js
```
