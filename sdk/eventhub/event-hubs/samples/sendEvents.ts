  This sample demonstrates how the send() function can be used to send events to Event Hubs.
  See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about to learn about Event Hubs.

  Note: If you are using version 2.1.0 or lower of @azure/event-hubs library, then please use the samples at
