 * The client is the main point of interaction with Azure Event Hubs service.
 * It offers connection to a specific Event Hub within the Event Hubs namespace along with
 * operations for receiving event data and inspecting the connected Event Hub.

 * - Use the connection string from the SAS policy created for your Event Hub instance.
 * - Use the connection string from the SAS policy created for your Event Hub namespace,
 * and the name of the Event Hub instance
 * - Use the fully qualified domain name of your Event Hub namespace like `<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net`,
 * and a credentials object.
