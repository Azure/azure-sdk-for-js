 * enqueued.
 *
 * Depending on the options specified when events are enqueued, they may be
 * automatically assigned to a partition, grouped according to the specified partition key,
 * or assigned a specifically requested partition.
 *
 * This model is intended to shift the burden of batch management from callers, at the cost of
 * non-deterministic timing, for when events will be published. There are additional trade-offs
 * to consider, as well:
 * - If the application crashes, events in the buffer will not have been published. To prevent
 *   data loss, callers are encouraged to track publishing progress using the
 *   `onSendEventsSuccessHandler` and `onSendEventsErrorHandler` handlers.
 * - Events specifying a partition key may be assigned a different partition than those using
 *   the same key with other producers.
 * - In the unlikely event that a partition becomes temporarily unavailable, the
 *   `EventHubBufferedProducerClient` may take longer to recover than other producers.
 *
 * In scenarios where it is important to have events published immediately with a deterministic
 * outcome, ensure that partition keys are assigned to a partition consistent with other
 * publishers, or where maximizing availability is a requirement, using the
 * `EventHubProducerClient` is recommended.
