 * base class `PartitionProcessor` which simply logs the incoming events. To provide your code to process incoming
 * events, extend this class and override the `processEvents()` method. For example:
 * ```js
 * class SamplePartitionProcessor extends PartitionProcessor {
 *     async processEvents(events) {
 *        // user code to process events here
 *        // Information on the partition being processed is available as properties on the `SamplePartitionProcessor` class
 *        // use `this.updateCheckpoint()` method to update checkpoints as needed
 *     }
