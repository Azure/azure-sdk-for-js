 * - Use the connection string from the SAS policy created for your Event Hub instance.
 * - Use the connection string from the SAS policy created for your Event Hub namespace,
 * and the name of the Event Hub instance
 * - Use the fully qualified domain name of your Event Hub namespace like `<yournamespace>.servicebus.windows.net`,
