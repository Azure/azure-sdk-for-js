# Azure Communication Call Automation client library for JavaScript

This package contains a JavaScript SDK for Azure Communication Call Automation. Call Automation provides developers the ability to build server-based, intelligent call workflows, and call recording for voice and PSTN channels.

[Overview of Call Automation][overview] | [Product documentation][product_docs]

## Getting started
### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
- An existing Communication Services resource. If you need to create the resource, you can use the [Azure Portal][azure_portal], the [Azure PowerShell][azure_powershell], or the [Azure CLI][azure_cli].

### Installing
```bash
npm install @azure/communication-call-automation
```

### Browser support
#### JavaScript Bundle
To use this client library in the browser, first you need to use a bundler. For details on how to do this, please refer to our [bundling documentation][build_doc].

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CallAutomationClient | `CallAutomationClient` is the primary interface for developers using this client library. It can be used to initiate calls by `createCall` or `answerCall`.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| CallConnection       | `CallConnection` represents a ongoing call. Once the call is established with `createCall` or `answerCall`, further actions can be performed for the call, such as `transfer` or `addParticipant`.                                                                                                                                       |
| CallMedia            | `CallMedia` can be used to do media related actions, such as `play`, to play media file. This can be retrieved from established `CallConnection`.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| CallRecording        | `CallRecording` can be used to do recording related actions, such as `startRecording`. This can be retrieved from `CallAutomationClient`.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Callback Events      | Callback events are events sent back during duration of the call. It gives information and state of the call, such as `CallConnected`. `CallbackUrl` must be provided during `createCall` and `answerCall`, and callback events will be sent to this url. You can use `callAutomationEventParser` to parse these events when it arrives. |
| Incoming Call Event  | When incoming call happens (that can be answered with `answerCall`), incoming call eventgrid event will be sent. This is different from Callback events above, and should be setup on Azure portal. See [Incoming Call][incomingcall] for detail.                                                                                        |

## Examples
### Initialize CallAutomationClient
```JavaScript
import { CallAutomationClient } from '@azure/communication-call-automation';

// Your unique Azure Communication service endpoint
const endpointUrl = '<ENDPOINT>';
const callAutomationClient = new CallAutomationClient(endpointUrl);
```

### Create Call
```JavaScript
import { CommunicationUserIdentifier } from "@azure/communication-common";
import { CallAutomationClient, CallInvite } from '@azure/communication-call-automation';

// target endpoint for ACS User
const target: CommunicationUserIdentifier = {
  communicationUserId:
    "8:acs:...",
}

// make invitation
const callInvite = new CallInvite(target);

// callback url to recieve callback events
const callbackUrl = "https://<MY-EVENT-HANDLER-URL>/events";

// send out the invitation, creating call
const response = callAutomationClient.createCall(callInvite, callbackUrl);
```

### Play Media
```JavaScript
// from callconnection of response above, play media of media file
const myFile: FileSource = { uri: "https://<FILE-SOURCE>/<SOME-FILE>.wav" }
const response = callConnection.getCallMedia().playToAll(myFile);
```
