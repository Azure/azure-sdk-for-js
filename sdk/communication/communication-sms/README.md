# Azure Communication SMS client library for JavaScript

Azure Communication SMS services gives developers the ability to send SMS messages from a phone number that can be purchased through Communication Services.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
- An existing Communication Services resource. If you need to create the resource, you can use the [Azure Portal][azure_portal], the [Azure PowerShell][azure_powershell], or the [Azure CLI][azure_cli].
- A phone number assigned to your Communication Services resource. See [how to acquire a phone number](#how-to-acquire-a-phone-number) for instructions on how to add a phone number to your Communication Services resource.

### Installing

```bash
npm install @azure/communication-sms
```

### How to acquire a phone number

Phone numbers can be acquired and assigned to a Communication Services resource from the [Azure Portal][azure_portal]. Instructions on how to get a phone number using the [Azure Portal][azure_portal] can be found [here][get_phone_number_az_portal].

You may also get a phone number by using the [`@azure/communication-administration`][azure_communication_admin] package. Instructions on how to use the package can be found in the [package's README][azure_communication_admin_readme].

## Key concepts

### SmsClient

`SmsClient` is the primary interface for developers using this client library. It provides an asynchronous method to send SMS messages.

## Examples

## Authentication

You can get a key and/or connection string from your Communication Services resource in [Azure Portal][azure_portal]. Once you have a key, you may authenticate with any of the following methods:

### Using a connection string

```typescript
import { SmsClient } from "@azure/communication-sms";

const connectionString = `endpoint=<Host>;accessKey=<Base64-Encoded-Key>`;
const client = new SmsClient(connectionString);
```

### Create a credential with `AzureKeyCredential`

```typescript
import { AzureKeyCredential } from "@azure/core-auth";
import { SmsClient } from "@azure/communication-sms";

const credential = new AzureKeyCredential("<Base64-Encoded-Key>");
const client = new SmsClient("<Host>", credential);
```

### Using Azure Active Directory managed identity

Client API key authentication is used in most of the examples, but you can also authenticate with Azure Active Directory using the [Azure Identity library][azure_identity]. To use the [DefaultAzureCredential][defaultazurecredential] provider shown below, or other credential providers provided with the Azure SDK, please install the [`@azure/identity`][azure_identity] package:

```bash
npm install @azure/identity
```

The [`@azure/identity`][azure_identity] package provides a variety of credential types that your application can use to do this. The README for @azure/identity provides more details and samples to get you started.

```typescript
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";
import { SmsClient } from "@azure/communication-sms";

let credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const client = new SmsClient(endpoint, credential);
```

## Sending SMS

```typescript
import { AzureKeyCredential } from "@azure/core-auth";
import { SmsClient } from "@azure/communication-sms";

const credential = new AzureKeyCredential("<Base64-Encoded-Key>");
const client = new SmsClient("<Host>", credential);

const response = await client.send({
  from: "+12345678902",
  to: ["+12345678901"],
  message: "Hey there!"
});
```
