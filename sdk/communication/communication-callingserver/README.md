# Azure Communication CallingServer client library for JavaScript

This package contains a JavaScript SDK for Azure Communication Services for CallingServer.
Read more about Azure Communication Services [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/overview)

[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/communication/communication-callingserver)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
- An existing Communication Services resource. If you need to create the resource, you can use the [Azure Portal][azure_portal], the [Azure PowerShell][azure_powershell], or the [Azure CLI][azure_cli].

- A deployed Communication Services resource. You can use the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) or the [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.communication/new-azcommunicationservice) to set it up.
- You must have a phone number configured that is associated with an Azure subscription

### Installing
```bash
npm install @azure/communication-callingserver
```

### Browser support

#### JavaScript Bundle

To use this client library in the browser, first you need to use a bundler. For details on how to do this, please refer to our [bundling documentation](https://aka.ms/AzureSDKBundling).
In `rollup.config.js`, add following customized name exports in `cjs` plugin.

```JavaScript

cjs({
  namedExports: {
    events: ["EventEmitter"],
    "@azure/communication-signaling": ["CommunicationSignalingClient", "SignalingClient"],
    "@opentelemetry/api": ["CanonicalCode", "SpanKind", "TraceFlags"]
  }
})

```

## Key concepts

`CallingServerClient` provides the functionality to make call connection, join call connection or initialize a server call.

## Examples

The following section provides several code snippets covering some of the most common Azure Communication Services tasks, including:

- [Client Initialization](#client-initialization)
- [Make a call to a phone number recipient](#make-a-call-to-a-phone-number-recipient)

### Client Initialization

To initialize the CallingServer Client, the connection string can be used to instantiate.

```typescript
import { CallingServerClient } from "@azure/communication-callingserver";

const connectionString = `endpoint=https://<resource-name>.communication.azure.com/;accessKey=<Base64-Encoded-Key>`;
const client = new CallingServerClient(connectionString);
```

### Make a call to a phone number recipient

Once the client is initialized, the `createCallConnection` method can be invoked:

```typescript
import { CreateCallOptions } from "@azure/communication-callingserver";

const createCallResponse = callingserver_client.createCallConnection(
    source="<from-phone-number>",
    targets="<to-phone-number-1>",
    createCallOptions=Something
);

```

- `from_`: Something.
- `to`: Something.
- `createCallOptions`: Something.
