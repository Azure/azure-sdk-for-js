# Azure Communication Chat client library for JavaScript

Azure Communication Services for Chat lets developers add chat capabilities to their app. Use this client library to manage chat threads and their users, and send and receive chat messages.

Read more about Azure Communication Services [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/overview)

## Getting started

## Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
- An existing Communication Services resource. If you need to create the resource, you can use the [Azure Portal][azure_portal], the [Azure PowerShell][azure_powershell], or the [Azure CLI][azure_cli].
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

### Installing

```bash
npm install @azure/communication-chat
```

### Browser support

#### JavaScript Bundle

To use this client library in the browser, first you need to use a bundler. For details on how to do this, please refer to our [bundling documentation](https://aka.ms/AzureSDKBundling).
In `rollup.config.js`, add following customized name exports in `cjs` plugin.

```JavaScript

cjs({
  namedExports: {
    events: ["EventEmitter"],
    "@azure/communication-signaling": ["CommunicationSignalingClient", "SignalingClient"],
    "@opentelemetry/api": ["CanonicalCode", "SpanKind", "TraceFlags"]
  }
})

```

## Key concepts

A chat conversation is represented by a thread. Each user in the thread is called a chat participant. Chat participants can chat with one another privately in a 1:1 chat or huddle up in a 1:N group chat. Users also get near-real time updates for when others are typing and when they have read the messages.

### ChatClient

`ChatClient` is the primary interface for developers using this client library. It provides asynchronous methods to create and delete a thread.

### ChatThreadClient

`ChatThreadClient` provides asynchronous methods to do the message and chat participants operations within the chat thread.

## Examples

### Initialize ChatClient

Use resource url and user access token to initialize chat client.

```JavaScript
import { ChatClient } from '@azure/communication-chat';
import { AzureCommunicationTokenCredential } from "@azure/communication-common";

// Your unique Azure Communication service endpoint
let endpointUrl = '<ENDPOINT>';
let userAccessToken = '<USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>';
let tokenCredential = new AzureCommunicationTokenCredential(userAccessToken);
let chatClient = new ChatClient(endpointUrl, tokenCredential);

```

### Create a thread with two users

Use the `createThread` method to create a chat thread.

`createChatThreadRequest` is used to describe the thread request:

- Use `topic` to give a thread topic;

`createChatThreadOptions` is used to set the optional params to create the thread:

- Use `participants` to list the chat participants to be added to the thread;
- Use `idempotencyToken` to specify a repeatable request

`createChatThreadResult` is the result returned from creating a thread. It contains a `chatThread` which is the thread that was created, as well as an `errors` property which will contain information about invalid participants if they failed to be added to the thread.

```Javascript
const createChatThreadRequest = {
  topic: "Hello, World!"
};
const createChatThreadOptions = {
  participants: [
    {
      id: '<USER_ID>',
      displayName: '<USER_DISPLAY_NAME>'
    }
  ]
};
const createChatTtreadResult = await chatClient.createChatThread(
  createChatThreadRequest,
  createChatThreadOptions
);
const threadId = createChatThreadResult.chatThread.id;
```

### Send a message to the thread

Use `sendMessage` method to sends a message to a thread identified by threadId.

`sendMessageRequest` is used to describe the message request:

- Use `content` to provide the chat message content;

`sendMessageOptions` is used to describe the operation optional params:

- Use `senderDisplayName` to specify the display name of the sender;
- Use `type` to specify the message type, such as 'text' or 'html' ;

`sendChatMessageResult` is the result returned from sending a message, it contains an ID, which is the unique ID of the message.

```JavaScript
const sendMessageRequest =
{
  content: 'Hello Geeta! Can you share the deck for the conference?'
};
const sendMessageOptions =
{
  senderDisplayName : 'Jack',
  type: 'text'
};
const sendChatMessageResult = await chatThreadClient.sendMessage(sendMessageRequest, sendMessageOptions);
const messageId = sendChatMessageResult.id;
```

### Receive messages from a thread

With real-time signaling, you can subscribe to listen for new incoming messages and update the current messages in memory accordingly.

```JavaScript

// open notifications channel
await chatClient.startRealtimeNotifications();
// subscribe to new notification
chatClient.on("chatMessageReceived", (e) => {
  console.log("Notification chatMessageReceived!");
  // your code here
});

```

Alternatively you can retrieve chat messages by polling the `listMessages` method at specified intervals.

```JavaScript
for await (const chatMessage of chatThreadClient.listMessages()) {
   // your code here
}
```

### Add Users to a thread

Once a thread is created, you can then add and remove users from that thread. By adding users, you give them access to be able to send messages to the thread.
You will need to start by getting a new access token and identity for that user. The user will need that access token in order to initialize their chat client.
More information on tokens here: [Authenticate to Azure Communication Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/authentication?tabs=javascript)

```JavaScript

const addParticipantsRequest =
{
  participants: [
    {
      id: { communicationUserId: '<NEW_PARTICIPANT_USER_ID>' },
      displayName: 'Jane'
    }
  ]
};

await chatThreadClient.addParticipants(addParticipantsRequest);

```

### Remove Users from a thread

Similar to above, you can also remove users from a thread. In order to remove, you will need to track the IDs of the participants you have added.

```JavaScript

await chatThreadClient.removeParticipant({ communicationUserId: '<MEMBER_ID>' });

```
