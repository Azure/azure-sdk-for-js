## Prerequisites

The sample is compatible with Node.js >= 8.0.0.

You need [an Azure subscription][freesub] and [an Azure Communication Service Instance][azcomsvc] to run these sample program.

Adapting the samples to run in the browser may require some additional consideration. For details, please see the [package README][package].

## Setup

To run the sample using the published version of the package:

1. Install the dependencies using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Edit the file `sample.env`, adding the correct credentials to access the Azure service and run the samples. Then rename the file from `sample.env` to just `.env`. The sample programs will read this file automatically.

3. Run whichever samples you like:

```bash
node threadOperationSample.js
```

Alternatively, run a single sample with the correct environment variables set (step 3 is not required if you do this), for example (cross-platform):

```bash
npx cross-env COMMUNICATION_CONNECTION_STRING="<connection string>" node threadOperationSample.js
```
