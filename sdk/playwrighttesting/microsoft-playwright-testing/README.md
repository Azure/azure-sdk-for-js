# Microsoft Playwright Testing preview

Microsoft Playwright Testing is a fully managed Azure service that uses the cloud to enable you to run Playwright tests with much higher parallelization across different operating system-browser combinations simultaneously. This means faster test runs with broader scenario coverage, which helps speed up delivery of features without sacrificing quality. The service also enables you to publish test results and related artifacts to the service and view them in the service portal enabling faster and easier troubleshooting. With Microsoft Playwright Testing service, you can release features faster and more confidently.

## Get Started
Follow these steps to run your existing Playwright test suite with the service.

### Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://aka.ms/mpt/create-azure-subscription) before you begin.
- Your Azure account must be assigned the [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner), [Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor), or one of the [classic administrator roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#classic-subscription-administrator-roles).
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) must be installed in the machine from where you are running Playwright tests. 

### Create a Workspace

1. Sign in to the [Playwright portal](https://aka.ms/mpt/portal) with your Azure account.

1. Create the Workspace.

    ![Create new workspace](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-testing-service/assets/12104064/d571e86b-9d43-48ac-a2b7-63afb9bb86a8)

    |Field  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Workspace Name** | A unique name to identify your workspace.<BR>The name can't contain special characters or whitespace. |
    |**Azure Subscription** | Select an Azure subscription where you want to create the workspace. |
    |**Region** | This is where test run data will be stored for your workspace. |

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you don't see this screen, select an existing workspace and go to the next section.

### Install Microsoft Playwright Testing package

1. Run this command to install the service package

    ```nodejs
    npm init @azure/microsoft-playwright-testing
    ```

Installing the service package will create a service config file named `playwright.service.config.ts`

The service configuration serves to:

- Direct and authenticate Playwright to the Microsoft Playwright Testing service.
- Add Microsoft Playwright Testing reporting to your config.
- Override timeouts for service operations, if needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure your project uses @playwright/test version 1.37 or above.

### Obtain region endpoint

1. In the [Playwright portal](https://aka.ms/mpt/portal), copy the command under **Add region endpoint in your set up**.

    ![Set workspace endpoint](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-testing-service/assets/12104064/d81ca629-2b23-4d34-8b70-67b6f7061a83)

    The endpoint URL corresponds to the workspace region. You might see a different endpoint URL in the Playwright portal, depending on the region you selected when creating the workspace.

### Set up environment

Ensure that the `PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL` that you obtained in previous step is available in your environment.

We recommend using `dotenv` module to manage your environment. With `dotenv` you'll be using the `.env` file to define your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget to add `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file in order to not leak your secrets.

```sh
npm i --save-dev dotenv
```

`.env` file

```nodejs
PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL=wss://eastus.api.playwright.microsoft.com/accounts/<workspace-id>/browsers
```

### Sign in to Azure

You need to sign in to Azure using Azure CLI to enable authentication via Entra ID.  Run the command to sign-in

```azurecli
az login
```

**NOTE**: If you are a part of multiple tenants, you will have to login to a particular tenant. Run `az login --tenant=<TENANT_ID>' to sign in to the tenant where the workspace is created. You can find the tenant id through these [steps.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/how-to-find-tenant)

### Run the tests

Run Playwright tests against browsers managed by the service using the configuration you created above.

```nodejs
npx playwright test --config=playwright.service.config.ts --workers=20
```

## Next steps

- Run tests in a [CI/CD pipeline.](https://aka.ms/mpt/configure-pipeline)

- Learn how to [manage access](https://aka.ms/mpt/manage-access) to the created workspace.

- Experiment with different number of workers to [determine the optimal configuration of your test suite](https://aka.ms/mpt/parallelism).
