 * This sample demonstrates how to create and run a Groundedness evaluation
 * using the AIProjectClient with inline dataset content.
 *
 * The OpenAI compatible Evals calls in this sample are made using the OpenAI client.
 * See https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference for more information.
 *
 * @summary This sample demonstrates how to use the synchronous
 * `openai.evals.*` methods to create, get and list evaluation and eval runs
 * for Groundedness evaluator using inline dataset content.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *    Given an AIProjectClient, this sample demonstrates how to use the
 *    `openai.evals.*` methods to create, get and list evaluation and eval runs
 *    for Groundedness evaluator using inline dataset content.
 *
 * USAGE:
 *    Set these environment variables with your own values:
 *    1) AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT - Required. The Azure AI Project endpoint, as found in the overview page of your
 *       Microsoft Foundry project. It has the form: https://<account_name>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project_name>.
 *    2) MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - Required. The name of the model deployment to use for evaluation.
