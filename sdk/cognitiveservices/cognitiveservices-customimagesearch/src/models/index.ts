  /**
   * Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing
   * often flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
   * traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple
   * requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
   * multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For example, if the
   * second request has a different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be
   * unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search
   * history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help
   * improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance
   * improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables
   * higher click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should
   * consider this header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
   * end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent user
   * experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing
   * APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated
   * client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns
   * it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT include this
   * header in a request is the first time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID
   * for each Bing API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the client
   * ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
   * across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the
   * device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that
   * device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
   * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
   * subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID,
   * you must not include cookies in the request.

   * Do not obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the

   * equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate

   * Pass the value returned by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for
   * GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
   * (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location. (The UNIX timestamp
   * is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative
   * heading or direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
   * counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
   * (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is
   * traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The
   * radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key
   * only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information
   * that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although optional, you are
   * encouraged to always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the location is
   * especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's
