   * improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables
   * higher click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should

   * end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent user
   * experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing
   * APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated
   * client ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns
   * it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT include this
   * header in a request is the first time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID
   * for each Bing API request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the client
   * ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
   * across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the
   * device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your app on that
   * device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
   * header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
