# Release History

## 1.16.0 ()

### Breaking Changes

- Default Sampler Changed: The default sampling behavior has been changed from `ApplicationInsightsSampler` with 100% sampling (all traces sampled) to `RateLimitedSampler` with 5.0 traces per second. This change significantly reduces telemetry volume for high-traffic applications and provides better cost optimization out of the box.
  - **Impact**: Applications with more than 5 requests per second will see fewer traces exported by default.
  - **Migration**: To maintain the previous behavior (100% sampling), explicitly configure the sampler by setting `tracesPerSecond: 0` which will fall back to using `samplingRatio: 1.0`.

### Other Changes

- Changed `CUSTOMER_SDKSTATS` SDK Stats feature to track when customers explicitly disable SDK stats by setting `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_SDKSTATS_DISABLED=true`.
- In double-instrumentation scenarios, surface a warning in the log stream in addition to diagnostic logs to help customers identify when they have both autoinstrumentation and manual instrumentation enabled.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed OpenTelemetry API version mismatch causing Noop providers in VS Code extensions. When a different version of `@opentelemetry/api` was already loaded (e.g. by the VS Code extension host), `useAzureMonitor` would silently fall back to Noop providers, discarding all telemetry. The fix clears the stale global API state before initializing the SDK.
