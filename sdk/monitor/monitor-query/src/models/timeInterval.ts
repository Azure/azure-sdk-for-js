 * Time Interval type for specifying timespan for querying logs and metrics.
 * A time interval is the intervening time between two time points.
 * The amount of intervening time is expressed by a duration The two time points (start and end) are expressed by either a combined date and time representation
 * or just a date representation.There are four ways to express a time interval:
 * - duration
 * - start time, end time
 * - start time, duration
 * - duration, end time
