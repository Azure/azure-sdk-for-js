### Features Added

- Fixing issue using non-commercial clouds, where it wasn't possible to pass in an endpoint and custom

  [PR#15705](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/15705)
- Adding a mitigation for LogsQueryClient.queryLogsBatch() where an invalidly encoded response could lead
  to no results being surfaced to the user. This should allow for the result to be properly parsed.
