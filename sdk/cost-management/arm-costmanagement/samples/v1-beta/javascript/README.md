| [generateCostDetailsReportCreateOperationSample.js][generatecostdetailsreportcreateoperationsample]                     | This API is the replacement for all previously release Usage Details APIs. Request to generate a cost details report for the provided date range, billing period (Only enterprise customers) or Invoice Id asynchronously at a certain scope. The initial call to request a report will return a 202 with a 'Location' and 'Retry-After' header. The 'Location' header will provide the endpoint to poll to get the result of the report generation. The 'Retry-After' provides the duration to wait before polling for the generated report. A call to poll the report operation will provide a 202 response with a 'Location' header if the operation is still in progress. Once the report generation operation completes, the polling endpoint will provide a 200 response along with details on the report blob(s) that are available for download. The details on the file(s) available for download will be available in the polling response body.

## Prerequisites

The sample programs are compatible with [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).

You need [an Azure subscription][freesub] to run these sample programs.

Samples retrieve credentials to access the service endpoint from environment variables. Alternatively, edit the source code to include the appropriate credentials. See each individual sample for details on which environment variables/credentials it requires to function.

Adapting the samples to run in the browser may require some additional consideration. For details, please see the [package README][package].

## Setup

To run the samples using the published version of the package:

1. Install the dependencies using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Edit the file `sample.env`, adding the correct credentials to access the Azure service and run the samples. Then rename the file from `sample.env` to just `.env`. The sample programs will read this file automatically.

3. Run whichever samples you like (note that some samples may require additional setup, see the table above):

```bash
node alertsDismissSample.js
```

Alternatively, run a single sample with the correct environment variables set (setting up the `.env` file is not required if you do this), for example (cross-platform):

```bash
npx cross-env  node alertsDismissSample.js
```
