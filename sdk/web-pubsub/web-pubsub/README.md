# Azure Web PubSub service client library for JavaScript

[Azure Web PubSub](https://aka.ms/awps/doc) is a service that enables you to build real-time messaging web applications using WebSockets and the publish-subscribe pattern. Any platform supporting WebSocket APIs can connect to the service easily, e.g. web pages, mobile applications, edge devices, etc. The service manages the WebSocket connections for you and allows up to 100K concurrent connections. It provides powerful APIs for you to manage these clients and deliver real-time messages.

Any scenario that requires real-time publish-subscribe messaging between server and clients or among clients, can use Azure Web PubSub service. Traditional real-time features that often require polling from server or submitting HTTP requests, can also use Azure Web PubSub service.

We list some examples that are good to use Azure Web PubSub service:

- **High frequency data updates:** gaming, voting, polling, auction.
- **Live dashboards and monitoring:** company dashboard, financial market data, instant sales update, multi-player game leader board, and IoT monitoring.
- **Cross-platform live chat:** live chat room, chat bot, on-line customer support, real-time shopping assistant, messenger, in-game chat, and so on.
- **Real-time location on map:** logistic tracking, delivery status tracking, transportation status updates, GPS apps.
- **Real-time targeted ads:** personalized real-time push ads and offers, interactive ads.
- **Collaborative apps:** coauthoring, whiteboard apps and team meeting software.
- **Push instant notifications:** social network, email, game, travel alert.
- **Real-time broadcasting:** live audio/video broadcasting, live captioning, translating, events/news broadcasting.
- **IoT and connected devices:** real-time IoT metrics, remote control, real-time status, and location tracking.
- **Automation:** real-time trigger from upstream events.

Use the library to:

- Send messages to hubs and groups.
- Send messages to particular users and connections.
- Organize users and connections into groups.
- Close connections
- Grant/revoke/check permissions for an existing connection

## Getting started

### Currently supported environments

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.x.x or higher

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
- An existing Azure Web PubSub service instance.

### 1. Install the `@azure/web-pubsub` package

```bash
npm install @azure/web-pubsub
```

### 2. Create and authenticate a WebPubSubServiceClient

```js
const { WebPubSubServiceClient } = require("@azure/web-pubsub");

const serviceClient = new WebPubSubServiceClient("<ConnectionString>", "<hubName>");
```

You can also authenticate the `WebPubSubServiceClient` using an endpoint and an `AzureKeyCredential`:

```js
const { WebPubSubServiceClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/web-pubsub");

const key = new AzureKeyCredential("<Key>");
const serviceClient = new WebPubSubServiceClient("<Endpoint>", key, "<hubName>");
```

## Key concepts

### Connection

Connections, represented by a connection id, represent an individual websocket connection to the Web PubSub service. Connection id is always unique.

### Hub

Hub is a logical set of connections. All connections to Web PubSub connect to a specific hub. Messages that are broadcast to the hub are dispatched to all connections to that hub. For example, hub can be used for different applications, different applications can share one Azure Web PubSub service by using different hub names.

### Group

Group allow broadcast messages to a subset of connections to the hub. You can add and remove users and connections as needed. A client can join multiple groups, and a group can contain multiple clients.

### User

Connections to Web PubSub can belong to one user. A user might have multiple connections, for example when a single user is connected across multiple devices or multiple browser tabs.

### Message

A message is either a UTF-8 encoded string or raw binary data.

## Examples

### Broadcast a JSON message to all users

```js
const { WebPubSubServiceClient } = require("@azure/web-pubsub");

const serviceClient = new WebPubSubServiceClient("<ConnectionString>", "<hubName>");
await serviceClient.sendToAll({ message: "Hello world!" });
```

### Broadcast a plain text message to all users

```js
const { WebPubSubServiceClient } = require("@azure/web-pubsub");

const serviceClient = new WebPubSubServiceClient("<ConnectionString>", "<hubName>");
await serviceClient.sendToAll("Hi there!", { contentType: "text/plain" });
```

### Broadcast a binary message to all users

```js
const { WebPubSubServiceClient } = require("@azure/web-pubsub");

const serviceClient = new WebPubSubServiceClient("<ConnectionString>", "<hubName>");

const payload = new Uint8Array(10);
await serviceClient.sendToAll(payload.buffer);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Enable logs

You can set the following environment variable to get the debug logs when using this library.

- Getting debug logs from the SignalR client library

```bash
export AZURE_LOG_LEVEL=verbose
```

For more detailed instructions on how to enable logs, you can look at the [@azure/logger package docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/core/logger).
