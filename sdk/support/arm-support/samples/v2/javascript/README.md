In such a case, contact your support engineer to request severity update by adding a new communication using the Communications API.<br/><br/>Changing the ticket status to _closed_ is allowed only on an unassigned case. When an engineer is actively working on the ticket, send your ticket closure request by sending a note to your engineer. x-ms-original-file: specification/support/resource-manager/Microsoft.Support/stable/2020-04-01/examples/UpdateStatusOfSupportTicketForSubscription.json                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Prerequisites

The sample programs are compatible with [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).

You need [an Azure subscription][freesub] to run these sample programs.

Samples retrieve credentials to access the service endpoint from environment variables. Alternatively, edit the source code to include the appropriate credentials. See each individual sample for details on which environment variables/credentials it requires to function.

Adapting the samples to run in the browser may require some additional consideration. For details, please see the [package README][package].

## Setup

To run the samples using the published version of the package:

1. Install the dependencies using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Edit the file `sample.env`, adding the correct credentials to access the Azure service and run the samples. Then rename the file from `sample.env` to just `.env`. The sample programs will read this file automatically.

3. Run whichever samples you like (note that some samples may require additional setup, see the table above):

```bash
node addCommunicationToSubscriptionTicket.js
```

Alternatively, run a single sample with the correct environment variables set (setting up the `.env` file is not required if you do this), for example (cross-platform):

```bash
npx cross-env  node addCommunicationToSubscriptionTicket.js
```
