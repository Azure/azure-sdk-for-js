# Azure Deidentification REST client library for JavaScript

`@azure-rest/health-deidentification` is a managed service that enables users to tag, redact, or surrogate health data.

<!-- **Please rely heavily on our [REST client docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/documentation/rest-clients.md) to use this library** -->
<!-- TODO Fix links once they are live use placeholden until then -->

## Getting started

### Currently supported environments

- LTS versions of Node.js

### Prerequisites

- You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to use this package.

### Install the `@azure-rest/health-deidentification` package

Install the Azure Deidentification REST client REST client library for JavaScript with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @azure-rest/health-deidentification
```

### Create and authenticate a `DeidentificationClient`

To use an [Azure Active Directory (AAD) token credential](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/identity/identity/samples/AzureIdentityExamples.md#authenticating-with-a-pre-fetched-access-token),
provide an instance of the desired credential type obtained from the
[@azure/identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/identity/identity#credentials) library.

To authenticate with AAD, you must first `npm` install [`@azure/identity`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity)

After setup, you can choose which type of [credential](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/identity/identity#credentials) from `@azure/identity` to use.
As an example, [DefaultAzureCredential](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/identity/identity#defaultazurecredential)
can be used to authenticate the client.

Set the values of the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret of the AAD application as environment variables:
`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`

Pull `ServiceUrl` from your created Deidentification Service.

Basic code snippet to create your Deidentification Client and Deidentify a string.

```javascript
import createClient, {
  DeidentificationContent,
  isUnexpected,
} from "@azure-rest/health-deidentification";
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const serviceEndpoint =
  process.env["DEID_SERVICE_ENDPOINT"] || "https://example.api.cac001.deid.azure.com";
const client = createClient(serviceEndpoint, credential);

const content: DeidentificationContent = {
  inputText: "Hello John!"
};

const response = await client.path("/deid").post({ body: content });

if (isUnexpected(response)) {
  throw response.body.error;
}

console.log(response.body.outputText); // Hello, Tom!
```

## Key concept

Operation Modes:

- Tag: Will return a structure of offset and length with the PHI category of the related text spans.
- Redact: Will return output text with placeholder stubbed text. ex. `[name]`
- Surrogate: Will return output text with synthetic replacements.
  - `My name is John Smith`
  - `My name is Tom Jones`

## Troubleshooting

### Logging

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling `setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```javascript
const { setLogLevel } = require("@azure/logger");

setLogLevel("info");
```

For more detailed instructions on how to enable logs, you can look at the [@azure/logger package docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/core/logger).
