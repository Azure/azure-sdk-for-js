| [rateCardGetSample.js][ratecardgetsample] | Enables you to query for the resource/meter metadata and related prices used in a given subscription by Offer ID, Currency, Locale and Region. The metadata associated with the billing meters, including but not limited to service names, types, resources, units of measure, and regions, is subject to change at any time and without notice. If you intend to use this billing data in an automated fashion, please use the billing meter GUID to uniquely identify each billable item. If the billing meter GUID is scheduled to change due to a new billing model, you will be notified in advance of the change. x-ms-original-file: specification/commerce/resource-manager/Microsoft.Commerce/preview/2015-06-01-preview/examples/GetRateCard.json |

## Prerequisites

The sample programs are compatible with [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).

You need [an Azure subscription][freesub] to run these sample programs.

Samples retrieve credentials to access the service endpoint from environment variables. Alternatively, edit the source code to include the appropriate credentials. See each individual sample for details on which environment variables/credentials it requires to function.

Adapting the samples to run in the browser may require some additional consideration. For details, please see the [package README][package].

## Setup

To run the samples using the published version of the package:

1. Install the dependencies using `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Edit the file `sample.env`, adding the correct credentials to access the Azure service and run the samples. Then rename the file from `sample.env` to just `.env`. The sample programs will read this file automatically.

3. Run whichever samples you like (note that some samples may require additional setup, see the table above):

```bash
node rateCardGetSample.js
```

Alternatively, run a single sample with the correct environment variables set (setting up the `.env` file is not required if you do this), for example (cross-platform):

```bash
npx cross-env COMMERCE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<commerce subscription id>" node rateCardGetSample.js
```

## Next Steps

Take a look at our [API Documentation][apiref] for more information about the APIs that are available in the clients.
