# Azure Tables client library for JavaScript

[Azure Tables](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/tables/) is a cloud-based service that stores structured NoSQL data, providing a key/attribute store with a schemaless design. Tables storage gives developers flexibility and scalability with all the best parts of Azure cloud.

Use the client library to:

- Create/Delete Tables
- Query/Create/Read/Update/Delete Entities
