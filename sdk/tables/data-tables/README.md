# Azure Tables client library for JavaScript

[Azure Tables](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/tables/) is a cloud-based service that stores structured NoSQL data, providing a key/attribute store with a schemaless design. Tables storage gives developers flexibility and scalability with all the best parts of Azure cloud.

Use the client library to:

- Create/Delete Tables
- Query/Create/Read/Update/Delete Entities

Azure Cosmos DB provides a Table API for applications that are written for Azure Table storage and that need premium capabilities like:

- Turnkey global distribution.
- Dedicated throughput worldwide.
- Single-digit millisecond latencies at the 99th percentile.
- Guaranteed high availability.
- Automatic secondary indexing.
- The Azure Tables client library can seamlessly target either Azure table storage or Azure Cosmos DB table service endpoints with no code changes.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Currently supported environments:

- Node.js version 8.x.x or higher
- Latest versions of Safari, Chrome, Edge and Firefox

You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and a [Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/tables/table-storage-quickstart-portal) or an [Azure CosmosDB database](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/create-cosmosdb-resources-portal) to use this package.

### Install the `@azure/data-tables` package

The preferred way to install the Azure Tables client library for JavaScript is to use the npm package manager. Type the following into a terminal window:

```bash
npm install @azure/data-tables
```

### Authenticate a `TableServiceClient`

Azure Tables supports several ways to authenticate. In order to interact with the Azure Tables service you'll need to create an instance of a Tables client - `TableServiceClient` or `TableClient` for example. See [samples for creating the `TableServiceClient`](#create-the-table-service-client) to learn more about authentication.

Note: Azure Tables doesn't support Azure Active Directory (AAD)

- [Service client with Shared Key](#tableserviceclient-with-tablessharedkeycredential)
- [Service client with Shared access signatures](#tableserviceclient-with-sas-token)
- [Table client with Shared Key](#tableclient-with-tablessharedkeycredential)
- [Table client with Shared access signatures](#tableclient-with-sas-token)

#### Following features, interfaces, classes or functions are only available in Node.js

- Shared Key Authorization based on account name and account key
  - `TablesSharedKeyCredential`
  - Account connection string.

#### JavaScript Bundle

To use this client library in the browser, first you need to use a bundler. For details on how to do this, please refer to our [bundling documentation](https://aka.ms/AzureSDKBundling).

#### CORS

You need to set up [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/cross-origin-resource-sharing--cors--support-for-the-azure-storage-services) rules for your storage account if you need to develop for browsers. Go to Azure portal and Azure Storage Explorer, find your storage account, create new CORS rules for blob/queue/file/table service(s).

For example, you can create following CORS settings for debugging. But please customize the settings carefully according to your requirements in production environment.

- Allowed origins: \*
- Allowed verbs: DELETE,GET,HEAD,MERGE,POST,OPTIONS,PUT
- Allowed headers: \*
- Exposed headers: \*
- Maximum age (seconds): 86400

## Key concepts

- `TableServiceClient` - Client that provides functions to interact at a Table Service level such as create, list and delete tables

- `TableClient` - Client that provides functions to interact at an entity level such as create, list and delete entities within a table.

- `Table` - Tables store data as collections of entities.

- `Entity` - Entities are similar to rows. An entity has a primary key and a set of properties. A property is a name, typed-value pair, similar to a column.

Common uses of the Table service include:

- Storing TBs of structured data capable of serving web scale applications
- Storing datasets that don't require complex joins, foreign keys, or stored procedures and can be de-normalized for fast access
- Quickly querying data using a clustered index
- Accessing data using the OData protocol filter expressions

  - [List Entities in a table](#list-entities-in-a-table)
  - [Create a new entity and add it to a table](#create-a-new-entity-and-add-it-to-a-table)

### Import the package

To use the clients, import the package in your file:

```javascript
const AzureTables = require("@azure/data-tables");
```

Alternatively, selectively import only the types you need:

```javascript
const { TableServiceClient, TablesSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/data-tables");
```

### Create the Table service client

The `TableServiceClient` requires a URL to the table service and an access credential. It also optionally accepts some settings in the `options` parameter.

#### `TableServiceClient` with `TablesSharedKeyCredential`

You can instantiate a `TableServiceClient` with a `TablesSharedKeyCredential` by passing account-name and account-key as arguments. (The account-name and account-key can be obtained from the azure portal.)
[ONLY AVAILABLE IN NODE.JS RUNTIME]

```javascript
const { TableServiceClient, TablesSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/data-tables");

// Enter your storage account name and shared key
const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";

// Use TablesSharedKeyCredential with storage account and account key
// TablesSharedKeyCredential is only available in Node.js runtime, not in browsers
const credential = new TablesSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const serviceClient = new TableServiceClient(
  `https://${account}.table.core.windows.net`,
  credential
);
```

#### `TableServiceClient` with SAS Token

Also, You can instantiate a `TableServiceClient` with a shared access signatures (SAS). You can get the SAS token from the Azure Portal.

```javascript
const { TableServiceClient } = require("@azure/data-tables");

const account = "<account name>";
const sas = "<service Shared Access Signature Token>";

const serviceClientWithSAS = new TableServiceClient(
  `https://${account}.table.core.windows.net${sas}`
);
```

#### List tables in the account

You can list tables within an account through a `TableServiceClient` instance calling the `listTables` function. This function returns a `PageableAsyncIterator` that you can consume using `for-await-of`

```javascript
const { TableServiceClient, TablesSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/data-tables");

const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";

const credential = new TablesSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const serviceClient = new TableServiceClient(
  `https://${account}.table.core.windows.net`,
  credential
);

async function main() {
  let tablesIter = serviceClient.listTables();
  let i = 1;
  for await (const table of tablesIter) {
    console.log(`Table${i}: ${table.name}`);
    i++;
    // Output:
    // Table1: testTable1
    // Table1: testTable2
    // Table1: testTable3
    // Table1: testTable4
    // Table1: testTable5
  }
}

main();
```

#### Create a new table

You can create a table through a `TableServiceClient` instance calling the `createTable` function. This function takes the name of the table to create as a parameter.

```javascript
const { TableServiceClient, TablesSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/data-tables");

const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";

const credential = new TablesSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const serviceClient = new TableServiceClient(
  `https://${account}.table.core.windows.net`,
  credential
);

async function main() {
  const tableName = `newtable${new Date().getTime()}`;
  await serviceClient.createTable(tableName);
}

main();
```

### Create the table client

The `TableClient` is created in a similar way as the `TableServiceClient` with the difference that `TableClient` takes a table name as a parameter

#### TableClient with `TablesSharedKeyCredential`

You can instantiate a `TableClient` with a `TablesSharedKeyCredential` by passing account-name and account-key as arguments. (The account-name and account-key can be obtained from the azure portal.)
[ONLY AVAILABLE IN NODE.JS RUNTIME]

```javascript
const { TableClient, TablesSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/data-tables");

// Enter your storage account name and shared key
const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";
const tableName = "<tableName>";

// Use TablesSharedKeyCredential with storage account and account key
// TablesSharedKeyCredential is only available in Node.js runtime, not in browsers
const credential = new TablesSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const client = new TableClient(`https://${account}.table.core.windows.net`, tableName, credential);
```

#### TableClient with SAS Token

Also, You can instantiate a `TableClient` with a shared access signatures (SAS). You can get the SAS token from the Azure Portal.

```javascript
const { TableClient } = require("@azure/data-tables");

const account = "<account name>";
const sas = "<service Shared Access Signature Token>";
const tableName = "<tableName>";

const clientWithSAS = new TableClient(`https://${account}.table.core.windows.net${sas}`, tableName);
```

#### List Entities in a table

You can list entities within a table by through a `TableClient` instance calling the `listEntities` function. This function returns a `PageableAsyncIterator` that you can consume using `for-await-of`

```javascript
const { TableClient, TablesSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/data-tables");

const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";
const tableName = "<tableName>";

const credential = new TablesSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const client = new TableClient(`https://${account}.table.core.windows.net`, tableName, credential);

async function main() {
  let entitiesIter = client.listEntities();
  let i = 1;
  for await (const entity of entitiesIter) {
    console.log(`Entity${i}: PartitionKey: ${entity.partitionKey} RowKey: ${entity.rowKey}`);
    i++;
    // Output:
    // Entity1: PartitionKey: P1 RowKey: R1
    // Entity2: PartitionKey: P2 RowKey: R2
    // Entity3: PartitionKey: P3 RowKey: R3
    // Entity4: PartitionKey: P4 RowKey: R4
  }
}

main();
```

#### Create a new entity and add it to a table

You can create a new Entity in a table by through a `TableClient` instance calling the `createEntity` function. This function takes the entity to insert as a parameter. The entity must contain `partitionKey` and `rowKey`.

```javascript
const { TableClient, TablesSharedKeyCredential } = require("@azure/data-tables");

const account = "<account>";
const accountKey = "<accountkey>";
const tableName = "<tableName>";

const credential = new TablesSharedKeyCredential(account, accountKey);
const client = new TableClient(`https://${account}.table.core.windows.net`, tableName, credential);

async function main() {
  const testEntity = {
    partitionKey: "P1",
    rowKey: "R1",
    foo: "foo",
    bar: 123
  };
  await client.createEntity(testEntity);
}

main();
```

## Troubleshooting

### General

When you interact with Tables service using the Javascript/Typescript SDK, errors returned by the service correspond to the same HTTP status codes returned for REST API requests:
[Storage Table Service Error Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/table-service-error-codes)

### Logging

Enabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling `setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:

```javascript
const { setLogLevel } = require("@azure/logger");

setLogLevel("info");
```
