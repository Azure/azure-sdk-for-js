### Acknowledgments

Thank you to our developer community members who helped to make the Azure Tables client library better with their contributions to this release:

- Eros Stein _([GitHub](https://github.com/eestein))_

### Features Added

- With the dropping of support for Node.js versions that are no longer in LTS, the dependency on `@types/node` has been updated to version 12. Read our [support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) for more details.
- Updated our internal core package dependencies to their latest versions in order to add support for Opentelemetry 1.0.0 which is compatible with the latest versions of our other client libraries.
- Changed TS compilation target to ES2017 in order to produce smaller bundles and use more native platform features
- Support for Azure Active Directory (AAD) authorization has been added to `TableServiceClient` and `TableClient`. This enables use of `TokenCredential` credentials. Note: Only Azure Storage API endpoints currently support AAD authorization. [#15852](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/15852)

### Fixed

- Fix [#15664](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/15701), adding check to make sure we always have only one forward slash (`/`) added to the end of the URL [#15698](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/15698) (A community contribution, courtesy of _[eestein](https://github.com/eestein))_
- Fix [#15701](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/15701) by improving error handling and reporting on `submitTransaction`. [#15852](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/15852)
- Fix [#15921](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/15921) incorrect `url` import and missing browser mapping for `computeHMACSHA256` [#15944](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/15944)
- Fix [#15854]https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/15854) by setting `allowInsecureConnection` to true when using the development connection string.

## 12.0.0 (2021-06-09)

- Added support for generating SAS tokens using an `AzureNamedKeyCredential` [#15564](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/15564)

## 12.0.0-beta.3 (2021-05-17)

## 1.0.0-beta.5 (2021-02-09)

### Breaking Changes

- Move generated client to use @azure/core-rest-pipeline. For more information about Core V2 read [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/core#core-v1-and-core-v2). [#12548](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/12548).
  - With this change, the response types no longer contain the raw response `_response`. To access the raw response, an `onResponse` callback has to be passed in the request options bag.
    ```typescript
    let createResult: FullOperationResponse | undefined;
    await client.createEntity(testEntity, { onResponse: (response) => (createResult = response) });
    ```
