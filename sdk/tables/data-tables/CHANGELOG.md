### Acknowledgments

Thank you to our developer community members who helped to make the Azure Tables client library better with their contributions to this release:

- Eros Stein _([GitHub](https://github.com/eestein))_

### Features Added

- With the dropping of support for Node.js versions that are no longer in LTS, the dependency on `@types/node` has been updated to version 12. Read our [support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) for more details.
