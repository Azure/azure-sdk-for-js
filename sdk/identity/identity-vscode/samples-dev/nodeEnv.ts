 * environment variable to determine whether or not to load the plugin.
 *
 * NOTE: The NODE_ENV environment variable is merely a convention, and you are
 * responsible for setting it as appropriate, for example, by setting the
 * variable at runtime:
 *
 * ```bash
 * $ NODE_ENV="production" node dist/nodeEnv.js
 * ```

 * @summary uses NODE_ENV to load the plugin only in development environments
