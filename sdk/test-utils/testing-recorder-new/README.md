## Azure testing-recorder-new library for JavaScript

This package tests the test-utils-recorder-new library, which is an experimental tool to record and playback the tests in the JS repo by leveraging the unified out-of-proc test proxy server. This library is still under construction.
Feature work is being tracked at [#15829](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/15829)

To run the tests, build the package and run the test:node command.
