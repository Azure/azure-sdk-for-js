// To better understand how this class works, it's necessary to comprehend how HTTP async requests are made:
// A new request object is created
//    let req = new XMLHttpRequest();
// The request is opened with some important information
//    req.open(method, url, async, user, password);
// Since we're dealing with an async request, we must set a way to know when the response is ready
//    req.onreadystatechange = function() {
//      if (req.readyState === 4) do_something;
//    }
// Finally, the request is sent to the server
//    req.send(data);

// Nise module does not have a native implementation of record/playback like Nock does
// This class overrides requests' 'open', 'send' and 'onreadystatechange' functions, adding our own code to them to deal with requests
