/**
 * ONLY WORKS IN THE NODE.JS ENVIRONMENT
 *
 * Meant to be called during the playback for the node tests.
 * 1. Takes the test filePath as argument.
 * 2. Looks for the `recordings` folder in its hierarchical path.
 * 3. Returns the full path of the `recordings` folder
 *
 * While running the tests, `filePath` can vary depending on location of the test files, examples below
 *
 * 1. If roll-up generated bundle files are being leveraged to run the tests
 *    filePath = `<base path>\azure-sdk-for-js\sdk\storage\storage-blob\dist-test\index.node.js`
 * 2. If ts complied dist-esm files are being used to run the tests
 *    filePath = `<base path>\azure-sdk-for-js\sdk\storage\storage-blob\dist-esm\test\utils.spec.js`
 *    filePath = `<base path>\azure-sdk-for-js\sdk\storage\storage-blob\dist-esm\test\node\utils.spec.js`
 * 3. If `.spec.ts` test files are being used directly
 *    filePath = `<base path>\azure-sdk-for-js\sdk\storage\storage-blob\test\utils.spec.ts`
 *    filePath = `<base path>\azure-sdk-for-js\sdk\storage\storage-blob\test\node\utils.spec.ts`
 * In the above examples, no matter where the test files are,
 *    the recordings are located at `<base path>\azure-sdk-for-js\sdk\storage\storage-blob\recordings\`.
 * In order to playback the tests, exact location of the recordings is to be found,
 *    this is done by checking the parent(s) folders until the `recordings` folder is found.
 *
 * @export
 * @param {string} filePath
 * @returns {string} location of the `recordings` folder
