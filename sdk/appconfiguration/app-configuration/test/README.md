# Testing

To test this project, make sure to build it by following our [building instructions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#building), then follow the [testing instructions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing).

You can use existing Azure resources for the live tests, or generate new ones by using our [New-TestResources.ps1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/eng/common/TestResources/New-TestResources.ps1) script, which will use an [ARM template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/master/sdk/appconfiguration/test-resources.json) that already has all of the the necessary configurations.

The Azure resource that is used by the tests in this project is:

- An [Azure App Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview). Your Azure application needs to be assigned as the **owner** of this Azure App Configuration resource. The steps are provided [below](#aad-based-authentication).

To run the live tests, you will also need to set the below environment variables:

- `TEST_MODE`: Should have `live` assigned.
- `APPCONFIG_CONNECTION_STRING`: The connection string of your Azure App Configuration account.
- `AZ_CONFIG_ENDPOINT`: The endpoint of your Azure App Configuration account.
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID of an Azure Active Directory application.
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret of an Azure Active Directory application.
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: The Tenant ID of your organization in Azure Active Directory.

The live tests in this project will add, modify and delete configurations on the provided Azure App Configuration account.

## AAD based authentication

The following steps will help you setup the AAD credentials.

### Register a new application in AAD

- Follow [Documentation to register a new application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) in the Azure Active Directory (in the Azure portal).
- Note down the `CLIENT_ID` and `TENANT_ID`.
- In the "Certificates & Secrets" tab, create a secret and note that down.

### Assign owner role to the registered application

- In the Azure portal, go to your Azure App Configuration and assign the **Owner** role to the registered application.
- This can be done from `Role assignment` section of `Access control (IAM)` tab (in the left-side-navbar of your Azure App Configuration in the Azure portal)<br>
  _Doing this would allow the registered application manage the resource, i.e., entity creation, deletion, etc.,_<br>
