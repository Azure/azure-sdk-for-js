These URLs are: RdTokenUri, RdBrokerURI, RdDiagnosticsUri and storage blob URLs for agent monitoring (geneva). If this check fails, it is non fatal and the machine still can service connections, main issue may be that monitoring agent is unable to store warm path data (logs, operations ...). \
 * **MonitoringAgentCheck**: Verifies that the required Geneva agent is running. If this check fails, it is non fatal and the machine still can service connections, main issue may be that monitoring agent is missing or running (possibly) older version. \
 * **DomainReachable**: Verifies the domain the SessionHost is joined to is still reachable. If this check fails is classified as fatal as no connection can succeed if the domain the SessionHost is joined is not reachable at the time of connection. \
 * **WebRTCRedirectorCheck**: Verifies whether the WebRTCRedirector component is healthy. The WebRTCRedirector component is used to optimize video and audio performance in Microsoft Teams. This checks whether the component is still running, and whether there is a higher version available. If this check fails, it is non fatal and the machine still can service connections, main issue may be the WebRTCRedirector component has to be restarted or updated. \
 * **SupportedEncryptionCheck**: Verifies the value of SecurityLayer registration key. If the value is 0 (SecurityLayer.RDP) this check fails with Error code = NativeMethodErrorCode.E_FAIL and is fatal. If the value is 1 (SecurityLayer.Negotiate) this check fails with Error code = NativeMethodErrorCode.ERROR_SUCCESS and is non fatal. \
 * **MetaDataServiceCheck**: Verifies the metadata service is accessible and return compute properties. \
 * **AppAttachHealthCheck**: Verifies that the AppAttachService is healthy (there were no issues during package staging). The AppAttachService is used to enable the staging\/registration (and eventual deregistration\/destaging) of MSIX apps that have been set up by the tenant admin. This checks whether the component had any failures during package staging. Failures in staging will prevent some MSIX apps from working properly for the end user. If this check fails, it is non fatal and the machine still can service connections, main issue may be certain apps will not work for end-users.
